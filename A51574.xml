            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY</head>
            <p>TO all True Chriſtian People that do or ſhall hereafter come to believe in this Third and Laſt Spiritual Commiſſion, is this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe</hi> directed, with love and peace to you be multiplied: It being a Legacy left you by the Lords laſt True Porphet, for your further eſtabliſhment in Truth: As alſo it is left for a Convincement of the Seed of Reaſon, when he is in the duſt; that by theſe <hi>Acts</hi> they may ſee how he hath been ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, reproached, and belied, perſecuted and impriſoned without a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>For how many Lying Reports hath been not only flung upon them, but alſo upon the True Believers of them; ſaying, <hi>That we own neither God nor Devil, Heven or Hell;</hi> and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee us uſe no outward glittering ſhew in fruitleſs Forms of Worſhip; whilſt we worſhip an inviſible Spiritual, yet perſonal God, in Spirit and Truth, which the World knows nothing of.</p>
            <p>For this we know and affirm, that the Doctrine of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Spirit is of as great purity and power, as to Godlineſs, as ever any was, and as they were themſelves, ever kept innocent from the breach of the Morral Law, as to Act; Even ſo the Fruits of their Doctrine is of the like efficacy in the knowing ſeed of Faith, by which they have dominion over Sin, as in reſpect of Act.</p>
            <p>And altho' this laſt Prophet in his Anſwer to the Nine Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath ſhewed his great mercy and clemency to ſome corrupt Natures, yet it is but to ſuch who act not ſo far; as the breach of
<pb facs="tcp:62853:3"/>
the <hi>Morral Law;</hi> as to borrow Money, and not to pay it again; or to be paſſionate and haſty natur'd, overcome with Strong Drink, or the like, and tho' theſe are evil, yet reach but to the Borders of the Law, being Frailties in Nature, which diſturb the peace of the Mind, for in ſuch things, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all:</hi> But where there is true Faith, it prevents the Act; as this Prophet ſaith in one place, among many his Words are theſe, <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>overcomes all Sin, Death and Hell, within a man's ſelf, and that none but ſuch ſhall be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Reev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> Doctrine is thus, ſaying, <hi>All thoſe that are led by the Voice of the holy Spirit of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>do work Righteouſneſs in their bodies whereby they die unto Sin.</hi> Again, ſaith he, in another place, <hi>The Light of Chriſt in man doth convert from the Ruling Power of Sin.</hi> And in a Third Place, which is not yet printed ſaith, <hi>That they that are led by the Spirit of Faith, are kept from the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin: I do not ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that they have no Motion to ſin, but the Spirit of Faith purifies their hearts, giving them power againſt thoſe Motions, that they commit not the Act; and from hence it is, that all that are born of God, know the Voice of God, and hath this Power over Sin, as I have declar'd,</hi> ſaid he.</p>
            <p>Theſe Doctrines of the Prophets are abſolute and poſſitive, and do give great light into ſeveral <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as <hi>Matt. Chap. 5. ver. 28. 1 John chap. 3. ver. 9.</hi> and <hi>ver. 15.</hi> in theſe places we are to diſtinguiſh between the Motion and the Action of Sin: This may alſo give light into <hi>Rom. chap. 7.</hi> how that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake there as to his ſtate by Nature, as alſo of the ſtrife and ſtrugle between the two Seeds of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> until the Law of <hi>Faith</hi> was quickened, and power by it attain'd, and then had he dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin, as <hi>Chap. 8.</hi> and ſo came to have peace with God, and with his own Conſcience, and Aſſurance of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>And from hence comes the Grounds of true Worſhip, and flows forth all ſpiritual Praiſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>O how ſweet is thy Law:</hi> This ſweet Law is the Law of Faith; and he or ſhe that is truly poſſeſſed hereof, can ſeal to thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Reeve,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>That he that is born of God, his Language and
<pb facs="tcp:62853:3"/>
Practice is ſuch as ſpeaks forth the Power of Godlineſs, to the confounding of all glittering Tongue Hipocrites, and Faithleſs Formaliſts</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all True Believers know, that under every Commiſſion this is made the ordinary way of Life and Salvation; yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent an objection, this is confeſſed by us: That tho' there is this power in Faith, as aforeſaid yet the Lord for the Tryal of his Creature, may ſuffer ſome of his Choſen Ones to fall in the time of a Commiſſion; and for the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, wherein he raiſeth that Soul to a high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r and greater meaſure of Grace, Wiſdom and Humility than it had before; which fulfils that Saying of <hi>Paul, Where Sin abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there Grace did ſuperabound.</hi> And this was fulfilled both by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee that if an Elect V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l ſhould once fall after his knowledge and belief in Truth, that his ſecond Pardon doth raiſe him to a higher degree of Grace, Wiſdom and Humility then he had before: This by the Prophet is made a true Tryal to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a repentance or converſion from the Act of Sin committed be real or fained; as alſo that a ſecond fail or relapſe will prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; becauſe it is rare to find a Third Pardon, and a Third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Grace to that Pardon.</p>
            <p>Thus it is made clear that the Doctrine of this Commiſſion of the Spirit it hath power of Purity in it, and n ne that is truly born of God can diſpute againſt it, but rather fear to offend, as the Prophet <hi>Reeve</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a true born Saint is afraid of
<pb facs="tcp:62853:4"/>
his own evil thoughts, much more of evil words or deeds againſt God or man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again we ſee by this Book of the Acts, that theſe two Prophets were jointly choſen of God, and made equal in Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for the Prophet <hi>Reeve</hi> ſaith, <hi>That his Fellow Witneſs had as great power as he had himſelf:</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>That he was the Lords laſt High-Prieſt:</hi> If this be granted, then it muſt follow, that there can be no Salvation to ſuch as ſhall reject him, or his Writings, altho' they pretend to own <hi>John Reeve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover the mighty ſufferings that theſe Prophets have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for their Teſtimony ſake are admirable; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all oppoſition, providence preſerv'd them ſo, as that they both died in their Beds in peace; and not only ſo, but this laſt Prophet liv'd to ſee the downfal of many of his great Enemies, and of his Perſecutors and Judges.</p>
            <p>Now to come to a concluſion of this <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> When the Prophet had wrote this Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he kept it by him, not letting any to ſee it; but about two Weeks before he died, it was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of one of us, that was his true Friend, and ancient Acquaintance; in order to be printed after his death: Which now with the aſſiſtance of ſome Friends, through providence it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and is recommended to the whole <hi>houſhold of Faith,</hi> which I doubt not, but it will be accepted of being a true Copy from the Original, there being nothing here printed but what is really his own; only you are to know that there are ſome things omited that are of a Temporal accompt, as a diſpute with Mr. <hi>Leader</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eclipſes and the hight of the Viſible Heavens; with ſome other particulars which, things are left out, becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Charge, for all cannot be Printed that is Writen, for it is evident that altho there is above a Hundred Sheets of theirs in print, yet is it not paſt a Third part of what is Writen by them two Witneſſes, for in the Year <hi>1682</hi> Mr. <hi>Delamaine</hi> did Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe ſo many of their Works, and bound up in a Book as contained <hi>1052</hi> pages in Folio, in which Book, and in what is printed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Scripture hath been Interpreted that are of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Salvation, But whether it may enter into the Heart of any that are Rich to be ſtirred up to Print the ſame, or whether the

Powers of the Nation may permit it We leave to Providence.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude, it is Requiſite to give you an Acompt of the Prophets Death and Burial which was thus upon the Firſt of <hi>March, 1697.</hi> the Prophet was taken with an Illneſs and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon which he ſaid theſe Words, <hi>Now hath God ſent Death unto me:</hi> And preſently after was helped to Bed, and tho' he kept his Bed, yet we could not perceive that he was Sick, only Weak and he lay as if he ſlept, but in ſuch quietneſs, as if he was nothing concerned with either Pain or Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>So that it was meer Age that took him away, which was the 14th day of <hi>March,</hi> he then departed this Life with as much peace and quietneſs as ever any man did, being about <hi>88</hi> Years of Age, ſo that he had that Bleſſing, to come to the Grave in a full Age, like as a Shock of Corn cometh in at its Seaſon. Upon the 16th day his Corps was remov'd to <hi>Larſimus Hall,</hi> and on the 17th day was from thence Attended on with two hundred forty eight Friends accompanying him to <hi>Bethleham Church-Yard,</hi> where he was Buried by his Fellow-VVitneſs, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own appointment.</p>
            <p>And thus was the Lord's Laſt Prophet brought to his Grave in peace, without noiſe, or without tumult, though thouſands of Spectators beheld it, and there they are both to remain until the coming of their Lord, their King, and their Redeemer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the High and Mighty God, and our God, and bleſſed are they that know their Voice, and wait for that day, and are not offended with theſe things.

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Prophet ſheweth firſt, That <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did record ſtrange and wonderful things; As alſo their <hi>Revelations,</hi> which we are bound to believe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THERE is, and hath been Recorded many and ſeveral wonderful ſtrange Things and Deeds of the righteous Fathers, as, <hi>Noah, Lott, Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of their Faith in God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And alſo, how wonderfully God did appear unto them, and ſtrengthen them in their time, when they were upon the Eearth. Theſe things are Recorded by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as God revealed it to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> declared his own Birth, and how he was preſerv'd from being drown'd: Theſe things did he declare, and how God appeared unto him and choſe him and <hi>Aron</hi> for that great Work, to lead that great People through the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and to be a Law-giver.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Which was the firſt viſible appearance of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, that is Recorded, for all Generations to come. For tho God did appear in a wonderful manner unto <hi>Enock, Noah, Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſeveral other righteous Men; yet we could never have known
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62853:6"/>
it, had not <hi>Moſes,</hi> by his <hi>Revelation,</hi> left it upon Record.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How could the Generations to come have known any thing of the Creation of the World, and how God made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Or that there ever was the Man <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi> that ſlew his Brother <hi>Abel;</hi> or that the World was ever drowned, except eight Perſons, if it had not been revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. So that we have nothing but <hi>Moſes</hi>'s bare Word for it; for we did not live in his time, to ſee the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he wrought, nor hear him ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Yet we are bound to believe his Record, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and Acts he did: And bleſſed and happy were all thoſe that did believe him when he was upon Earth, when they ſaw his Acts, and heard him ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And more bleſſed are theſe now, that underſtand and believe, which have not ſeen his Wonders he wrought in his time, not heard him ſpeak forth thoſe <hi>Revelations</hi> God revealed unto him concerning the Creation of the World as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Alſo we read in Scripture of many wonderful Acts that was wrought and done by the Prophets, in the time of the Law, after <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. As <hi>Samuel, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Eljah, Eliſha,</hi> and ſeveral other Prophets, in the time of the Law; their wonderful Acts are recorded in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Beſides the <hi>Revelation</hi> they declared as from God, which the Ages following did not ſee nor hear, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did truly believe, and doth truly belive, and are by Faith ſatisfied, as thoſe that did both hear and ſee.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So that the Scriptures Record, is a Record of ſpiritual and heavenly Things, and of ſome of thoſe wonderful and powerful Acts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the righteous Fathers, manifeſting their great Faith in God and being in favour with God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Which I, by Faith, have found their Record
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62853:6"/>
true, and ſo have many more of the ſeed of Faith found their Record and <hi>Revelations</hi> to be true.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Prophet makes a Rehearſal of the Acts of the Apoſtles in the new Teſtament, and of the Lord Chriſt, and how that they were writen for the Comfort of the Seed of Faith: After which he enters upon the third Record, and ſhows the cauſe of his writing ſome of the moſt principal Acts of the Witneſs of the Spirit under this third Record.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ALSO we find written in the New Teſtament many wonderful Acts and Miracles, acted by the Lord Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; as <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> doth declare concerning Chriſt; that if all the things Chriſt ſpake and Acts he did were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the World would not contain the Volume.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That is, the verge of a Man's underſtanding could not retain the particulars, ſo as to tell it to his Friend, the particulars would be ſo many.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So likewiſe, <hi>the Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> that Book hath little elſe in it, but wonderful Acts wrought by the power of Faith in the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And theſe things were written for the ſeed of Faith, that they might have Comfort in believing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that is given of the Apoſtles, how God ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in Faith and Power, as by the power of Faith to work Miracles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe they were choſen of God to bear Record on Earth, to the Blood of the New Teſtament, or, New Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62853:7"/>6. Thus did the Apoſtles bear Record on Earth to the Blood, as the Prophets did bear Record on Earth to the Water, which ſignifies the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Blood ſignifies the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Scriptures are a Record, that ſheweth many wonderful Acts that Chriſt and his Appoſtles did when on Earth, beſides the heavenly Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And it is very comfortable to the Seed of Faith, true Belivers, to read of the Acts of the Prophets, and of the Apoſtles, as it is of their Doctrin, Revelation, Propheſies, Interpretations; or, Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Theſe Things, I having experience of, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath been the Practice of ſome of the Prophets and Apoſtles to leave a Record behind them, for after Ages to peruſe, of ſome of the moſt remarkable Acts, done by them when they were upon Earth, as a remarkable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to their Propheſies and Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So, likewiſe I being one of the two laſt Prophets and Witneſſes of the Spirt, being the Third and laſt Record from God on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I thought it convenient and expedient to leave ſome Record on Earth, behind me, of ſome of the moſt remarkable Acts and Paſſages that hath been done and acted by us, and to us, the Witneſſes of the Spirit, ſince we were choſen of God in the Year 1651.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That I may leave it as a Legaſy to the Seed of Faith after me, who ſhall happen to Read and Believe thoſe Writings of ours after I am gon.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. They may know by the Doctrin therein decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who, and what we were, and what God we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Alſo I thought it neceſſary to write of thoſe Acts my ſelf, rather then any other, being acted in my ſight and perfect knowledge, as other Profits have done before me, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and others.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. BUT before I write of the Acts, I ſhall give the Reader a little to underſtand what we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did chuſe us two, to be his two laſt Prophets and Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And of ſome Experince I had, and Working within me before I was Choſen of God, little expecting God would have choſen me for ſuch a great Work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for <hi>John Reeve,</hi> he was born in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> his Father was Clerk to a <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Gentleman as we call them by his place, but fell to decay.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So he put <hi>John Reeve</hi> Apprentice here at <hi>London,</hi> to a <hi>Taylor</hi> by Trade. He was out of his Apprentiſhip before I came aquainted with him, he was of an Honeſt, Juſt Nature, and Harmleſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But a Man of no great Natural Witt, or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no Subtilty, or Pollicy was in him, nor no great ſtore of Religeon he had, but what was Traditional, only of an Innocent Life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I knew him many years before God ſpake to to him by Voice of Words to the hearing of the Ear, three Mornings together, as is declar'd in the Commiſſion Book, call'd a <hi>Tranceſendant Spritual Treatiſe,</hi> the firſt Book he writ.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And I <hi>Lodwick Muggleton</hi> was born in <hi>Biſhop gate-ſtreet,</hi> near the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Devonſhire</hi>'s Houſe, at the corner Houſe call'd <hi>Walnut-Tree-Yard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62853:8"/>8. My Fathers name was <hi>John Muggleton,</hi> he was a <hi>Smith</hi> by Trade, that is a <hi>Farrier,</hi> or <hi>Horſe-Doctor,</hi> he was in great Reſpect with the <hi>Poſt-Maſter</hi> in King <hi>Jame</hi>'s time, he had three Children by my Mother, two Sons and one Daughter, I was the youngeſt and my Mother lov'd me.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But after my Mother dy'd, I being but young, my Father took another Wife; ſo I being young was Expos'd to live with Srangers in the Country, at a diſtance from all my Kindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was a Stranger to my Fathers Houſe after my Mother was dead.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But it came to paſs when I was grown to 15 or 16 Years of age, I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Apprentice to one <hi>John Quick,</hi> a Taylor, he made Livery Gowns, and all ſorts of Gowns for Men, he made Gowns for ſeveral Aldermen, and Livery Men of their Company in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. And he lived in this <hi>Walnut-Tree-Yard,</hi> and knew my Father and Mother very well; he was a quiet peaceable Man, not crewel to Servants, which liked me very well.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For my Nature was always againſt Cruelty, I could never indure it, neither in my ſelf, nor in others, living peaceably in my Apprentiſhip.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I took my Trade well; and pleaſed my Maſter better then any of his other Servants, for they were bad Husbands, and given to Drunkenneſs, but my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was inclin'd to be ſober, hating Drunkenneſs and Luſt in the time of my Youth.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But when my time of Service was pretty far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, I grew to more underſtanding, and hearing in thoſe days a great talk amongſt the vulger People, and eſpecially, amongſt Youth, Boys, and young Maids, of a people called <hi>Puritans;</hi> ſome of theſe <hi>Puritans</hi> came to talk and diſcourſe with my Maſter, though he was no Religious Man.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But I being ignorant, did perceive they pleaded more for Righteouſneſs, and were better verſed in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62853:8"/>
Scriptures then he was, ſo that I liked in my ſelf their Diſcourſe upon the Scriptures, and pleaded for a Holy keeping of the Sabbath-day, which my Maſter did not do, nor I his Servant.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But I not knowing my Right Hand from my Left in Religion at that time; yet, methoughts I had a Love for thoſe People call'd <hi>Puritans,</hi> and could not endure my Companions ſhould ſpeak Evil of them.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And when young Boys as I was, and young Maids would ſpeak Evil, and lay many Slanders upon thoſe People call'd <hi>Puritans,</hi> as if they had been the wickedeſt People in the World, with many Scoffs and Jears.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Yet all this while my Heart did not cloſe with their Reproaches, but rather was inclin'd to love thoſe People, and to think the better of them, thinking in my ſelf, Oh! that I might be ſo happy as them, yet I knew not what Happineſs was, nor what Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was, for I knew nothing by my ſelf, why I ſhould be Condemned.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But the Seed of God lay hidden in my Heart, which kept me from ſpeaking Evil of things I knew not, even from my Childhood, which many others of my Age did.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Like unto thoſe Children that mocked the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> which two ſhe Bares did tare in pieces; ſo many of theſe mockers of Religion, in that my time did come to great Poverty and Deſtruction in this World, but the God of Truth preſerved me, though I knew him not.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Alſo I was ſmitten with the Plague in that great ſickneſs after King <hi>James</hi> dyed; it was not extream te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to me, for the ſore broke, and I recovered quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hath not had half a days ſickneſs ſince, not this forty Years and more.</p>

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62853:9"/>22. I never beſtowed Six-pence in Phyſick in my Life for my ſelf, but what the Kitchen would afford, as Water-gruel, Broth, or ſuch like, and I have had my Health, and hath been as perfect in Nature from all Diſtempers and Diſeaſes, as any Man in the World ever ſince.</p>

                     <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> How the ſecret providence of God prevented the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Prophet in his choice of a Wife, and in his deſire of Riches, of the Prophet's Zeal for the Law, and a Righteous Life.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this it came to paſs my time of Service grew near out, and my Nature had a great deſire to be rich in this World, that I might no more be Servant to any Man, and I thought the Trade of a Taylor would not gain much Riches, I having little to begin with; and withal, I thought I ſhould be too much ſubject to the humours of People to pleaſe them, which I had experience of in my Apprentiſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So I went to work in a Brokers Shop in <hi>Howns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi> who made Cloaths to ſell, and did lend Money upon Pawns, called a Pawn-broker, and the Brokers Wife had one Daughter alive; and after I had been there a while, the Mother ſaw that I was a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and knew how to manage that way, being a Workman better than they, and that I was a civil and ſober young Man, not given to Drunkenneſs nor no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. She was willing to give her Daughter unto me to Wife, and I lov'd the Maid well, and thought my ſelf too inferiour for her, becauſe ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62853:9"/>
to take too, and the Onely Child; and I having nothing, yet the Mother being well perſwaded of my good natural Temper, and of my good Husbandry, and that I had no poor Kindred came after me to be any Charge or Burthen to her Daughter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe things conſider'd, ſhe thought I might be a convenient Match for her Daughter; ſo ſhe ſeeing there was ſome kind of Affection between her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and me, ſhe propoſed unto me, that ſhe would give me a Hundred Pound with her to ſet up, which thing I axcepted on in my Mind, but told I was not yet a Free-man of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. So ſhe urged me to be made Free as ſoon as I could, alſo ſhe urged me to be made ſure to her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Father-in-law and her ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So the Maid and I were made ſure by Promiſe before her Mother and Father-in Law, and before I was made Free; and I was reſolved to have the Maid to Wife, and to keep a Brokers Shop, and lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon Pawns, and grow Rich as others did.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And the Maids Mother had Five Hundred Pounds more then what ſhe promiſed me, which her Husband knew not of, for he was a kind of a Diſtracted Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Man; his Name was <hi>Richardſon,</hi> there is many alive at this Day that knew them; but for the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhould have had to Wife, ſhe is alive at this Day, and is worth Seven Hundred Pound a Year.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But the ſecret Providence of God prevented my expectation and deſire of being Rich in this World, in an unlawful way againſt the Checks of my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But it came to paſs in the 22d. Year of my Life, not being quite out of my Apprenticeſhip, yet ſure to the Maid, I went to work as a Journey-man, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to work with a <hi>Puritan</hi> in <hi>Thomas Apoſtle Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> His name was <hi>William Reeve, John Reeves</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62853:10"/>10. He was a very zealous <hi>Puritan</hi> at that time, and many others of that Religion came to him, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with me about the unlawfulneſs of lending Money upon Pawns, becauſe they pleaded it was Uſury and Extortion, and did alledge many places of Scripture againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And I uſed all the Arguments of Reaſon I could for it, becauſe I had a great deſire to be Rich, and conſidering I was ingaged to this Maid, and that her Mother would not let me have her to Wife, except I would keep a Brokers Shop and lend Money, ſo that I was in great ſtrait, and much perplexed in Mind.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For I lov'd the Maid, and deſired to be Rich, but theſe <hi>Puritan</hi> People being well verſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, and zealous for Righteouſneſs, threatened great Judgments, and danger of Damnation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. They overpowered my Natural Knowledge and civil Practiſes in me, and made me afraid of eternal Damnation, and they preſſed the Scriptures ſo hard upon me, which exceedingly perplexed my Mind, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in my ſelf, that if I did lend Mony upon Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Extortion, I ſhould be damned, and if I would not, then I ſhould not have the Maid to Wife.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So that the love of the Maid, and the fear of the loſs of my Soul did ſtruggle witin me, and diſpute within me like two diſtinct Spirits, even as a Woman in Travail with two natural Sons in the Womb, ſo that I was in a great ſtrait which I ſhould cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. So after much diſpute and reaſoning in my ſelf, it came to this reſult, I conſidered the Riches of this World, and the Love I had to the Maid, and I weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in my Mind, and was loath to forſake it.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then I conſider'd my Soul was of more value, and what would it avail me to be rich in this World
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62853:10"/>
for a Moment, and to looſe my Soul, for I was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful of eternal Damnation, thinking my Soul might go into Hell Fire without a Body, as all People did at that time.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And after much ſtrugling in my Mind, I came to this reſolution in my ſelf, that rather then I would looſe my Soul, or be damned to Eternity, I would looſe the Maid. And that way that would have made me Rich, and that I would be zealous of the Law of God, as afterwards I was.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Here the two Seeds of Faith and Reaſon did work in me, but I knew them not by Name nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at that time, nor many Years after.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But as I did fear, it came to paſs, for the Maids Mother ſeeing my Mind ſo changed, and ſo zealous of the Laws of the Scriptures, and that I would not keep that way, as I thought to do before.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. She would not let her Daughter have me to her Husband, ſo the Maid was perſwaded by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And my Zeal to ſave my Soul, perſwaded my Mind to let her go, ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Thus I forſook the World and a Wife, which I lov'd in the days of my ignorance, for zeal to the Law of God, which I thought to be Truth, and the true way, and ſo it was.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But I did not know it till many years after; but the Lord God of Truth had reſpect unto my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Zeal at that time, and prevented me from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into that Snare of being rich in this World.</p>

                     <hi>CAP. V.</hi> The Prophet ſhews his Care, his Fear, and Zeal in the Law of God, and of the working of his Thoughts, and heighth of the Puritan Religion.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. SO after I had parted with the Maid, and that way that did offend my Conſcience, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to live ſo upright to the Law of God, and ſo juſt between Man and Man, that I thought in time I might procure favour with God, and to attain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For I was fully poſſeſt that there was really Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be attained unto by my Righteouſneſs, and that there was a real Damnation to all thoſe that were unrighteous, or did not demean themſelves ſo ſtrictly as I did.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For I was exceeding fearful of Hell and eternal Damnation: The very Thoughts of it made my Spirit many times fail within me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But by Prayer, and my Righteous Practices, I did many times recover ſome Hope and Peace again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All this while I did ſuppoſe my Soul might go into Hell without a Body, and that Millions of Souls were in Hell-Fire without Bodies; and that the Devil being a Bodily Spirit did torment thoſe Souls that came there, and that the Devil had liberty to come out of Hell to Tempt People here on Earth, and go there again, but no Soul that he had gotten there could come out of Hell more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe things wrought in my Mind exceeding great Fear, and ſtir'd me up to a more exceeding Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, thinking thereby that my Righteous Life
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62853:11"/>
would have caſt out thoſe tormenting Fears, but it did not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yet, notwithſtanding, I did continue in my Zeal, and was earneſt in the <hi>Puritant</hi> Religion and Practice; neither did I know how to find Reſt any where elſe; neither did I hear any Preach in thoſe Days but the <hi>Puritan</hi> Miniſters, whoſe Hair was cut ſhort.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For if a Man with long Hair had gone into the Pulpit to preach, I would have gone out of the Church again, tho he might preach better than the other.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But we <hi>Puritans</hi> being Phariſaically minded were zealous of outward Appearance, and of outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for we minded that more than their Doctrin.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For we took it for granted, that God was a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without a Body, and that Chriſt Jeſus his Son had a Body in form like Man, and that he did mediate to God his Father, who was a Spirit without a Body, and that for Chriſt's ſake, this Spirit without a Body, did hear us, and ſpeak Peace unto us.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Alſo I believed that the Devil was a Spirit without a Body, and could aſſend out of Hell, when God did give him leave, and ſugeſt evil Thoughts of Luſt, Theft, Murther, and Blaſphemy againſt God; not thinking that theſe Thoughts and Motions did ariſe out of Man's own Heart, but from a Divel, a Spirit without a Body, without Man.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Alſo I thought, thoſe Souls which God did Save were carried up to Heaven without Bodies, and ſhould be with God, who was a Spirit without a Body, and that we ſhould ſee Chriſt Jeſus in Heaven, with his Body, with our Spirits that were Saved without Bodies, till the Reſurrection, and then Body and Soul ſhould be United together again.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Alſo we did believe, that the wicked Spirits ſhould be caſt into Hell Fire without Bodies, where the Devil and his Angels, being Spirits without Bodies,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62853:12"/>
ſhould Torment the Souls of the Wicked till the Day of Reſurrection; and then thoſe Wicked Souls ſhould be United to their Bodies again, and be Tormented Body and Soul together, with the Devil and his Angels, who were Spirits without Bodies in Hell Fire for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And we did believe that the Angels of God were Miniſtring Spirits without Bodies, as God was a Spirit without a Body, ſo were they, and could miniſter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts unto Men without Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And we did believe our own Souls to be Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and could not Die, but did ſubſiſt the good Spirits with God in Heaven without Bodies, and the wicked Souls did ſubſiſt in Hell without Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Theſe were ſome of the Fundamental Principles of Faith and Religion, we Zealous <hi>Puritans</hi> did believe and practice; and there is no better Faith in the World to this day in the generality of Profeſſors of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Theſe Things was I very well verſed in, and I grew in great Experience and Knowledge in the Letter of the Scriptures, and had a good Gift of Prayer, and was very ſtrong in Diſputes, becauſe my Mind was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly perplexed with the fear of Hell, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my exact life to the Letter of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But the fear of Hell wrought in me much Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſo that I did exceed ſeveral other Men in that Knowledge which was in thoſe days; and tho' I was judged a very godly knowing-Man, and a happy Man by others, yet I could not judge ſo of my ſelf, but the fear of Hell was oft riſing up in me.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For I never Conceited well of my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but thought the Knowledge of other Men did far exceed me, becauſe they ſeemed to be better ſatisfied in their Minds than I was.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Yet I thought in my ſelf, that in time, by my Prayers and Righteouſneſs, and exact Walking and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62853:12"/>
hearing of Preaching, that I might heal that Wound in my Soul which was made, and I knew not for what.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For I never had committed any Sin that I knew of that did trouble my Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Yet the fear of Hell produced many deep Sighs and Groans even from the bottom of my Heart, for fear God had made me a Reprobate before I was Born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not anſwer my Prayers, nor ſpeak Peace to my Soul; notwithſtanding my earneſt Deſires and Zeal for him I knew not at that time.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Yet many times I had great Refreſhments of Soul, and as I thought, Communion with God, whereby my Hope was increaſed for a Seaſon, but it was quickly loſt again; ſo that the Troubles of my Mind did continue ſtill many years.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Yet at ſome times I had Elevaſions in my Mind, and Raptures of Joy, that I thought I ſhould never be moved again.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. But a while after all was loſt again, and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing took place in my Soul; but ſince, I ſaw the cauſe of thoſe Raptures and fears of Hell were both ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFter this, it came to paſs in the Twenty ſixth year of my Life, I took a Wife that was of my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62853:13"/>
own Mind and Religion. She was a Virgin of about 19 years of Age, and I had by her Three Daughters in three years and an half's time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt Daughter I had by her was named <hi>Sarah,</hi> after her Mother's Name: She is yet alive, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt experimental and knowing'ſt Women in Spiritual Things of that Sex in <hi>London;</hi> but I ſhall ſay no more of her here, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of her hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo my youngeſt Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which I had by my Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> is now living, but the ſecond Daughter died; when three years and an half was expired my Wife <hi>Sarah</hi> died alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After this, my Children being young, I put them forth to Nurſe in the Country, and lived a ſingle Life, and followed my Trade, and lived very well.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Only the Spirit of fear of Hell was ſtill upon me, but not ſo extream as it was the year before.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After this, in the Thirty ſecond year of my Life, I took another Virgin to Wife; Her Name was <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe was about nineteen years old, and I had by her three Children, two Sons and one Daughter; the eldeſt died at three years old, and the youngeſt was a Daughter and ſhe died three days after ſhe was born, and my Wife <hi>Mary</hi> died five days after.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I had only one Son living by her, and I had her to Wife a matter of ſix years; and that Son lived until <hi>John Reeve</hi> and I was choſen of God; and about a year and an half afterwards, being about nine years old, he died; ſo all the Children of my ſecond Wife died.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. After my Wife <hi>Mary</hi> died, I was then about Thirty eight years old; but at the time when I was Married to my Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> about ſix years before, there was Raiſing of Arms by the Parliament againſt the King.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62853:13"/>9. And generally the <hi>Puritans</hi> were all for the Parliament, and moſt of my Society and Acquaitance in Religion did fall away from that way we did uſe, and declined in Love one towards another, and every one got a new Judgment, and new Acquaitance, and new Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Some of them turned to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and would have Elders; and ſome turned <hi>Independants,</hi> and would not let none work to them but their own People that was in Church Fellowſhip; others fell to be <hi>Ranters,</hi> and ſome fell to be meer <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. So that our <hi>Puritan</hi> People were ſo divided and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in our Religion, that I knew not which to take too, or which to cleave unto, for I was altogether at a loſs, for all the Zeal we formerly had was quite worn out.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And to joyn with any of theſe new Diſciplines I could not, except I would play the Hypocrite for a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which my Heart always hated, notwithſtanding my Kindred by my firſt Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> where all <hi>Puritans</hi> and Zealous in Religion.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And I had a great ſtroke of Work of them, and they were a great Generation of them, and moſt of them pritty Rich in this World; and moſt of them went into Church Fellowſhip, ſo that I loſt ſeveral of them becauſe I could not joyn in Church Fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For thought I, there is no more ſatisfaction to be found in Church Fellowſhip than before, for none could ſerve God and be more Zealous for God and for Righteouſneſs than we were before.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. So that going into Church Fellowſhip would not ſatisfie my Soul, as to my Salvation, no more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. For ſatisfaction of Mind, as to another Life, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways my Aim and End that I ſtrove after, but could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it as yet.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So I being at a great loſs in my Mind, what to do, I had loſt my Friends and Relations becauſe I could not follow them in Church Fellowſhip, and I had no freedom in my ſelf ſo to do.</p>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62853:14"/>18. For I had ſeen the utmoſt Perfection and Satisfaction that could be found in that way, except I would do it for Loaves, but Loaves was never my aim, but a real reſt in my Mind I always ſought after, but could find it no where.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Prophet ſhews his great diſſatisfaction and loſs in Religion, even almoſt to Diſpair, yet in the Concluſion, reſolves to hold his Integrity, to do Juſtly, and keep from actual Sin, but mind Religion no more, but left Happineſs and Miſery to Gods diſpoſal.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. SO I ſeeing theſe <hi>Puritans</hi> of my Acquaintance they had no Comfort nor Peace of Mind, as to a Life to Come, that were in Church Fellowſhip than before, nor ſo much.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then I ſaw ſeveral of them that were Zealous before towards God, and Righteouſneſs towards Man; and now they had left that Zeal, and turned Ranters, not only in Judgment but in Practice, to the Deſtruction both of Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When I ſaw this, that neither the Righteous could find Peace in the Days of their Righteouſneſs, but were afraid of Hell; nor thoſe that turned from their Righteouſneſs to actual Wickedneſs, I thought I muſt needs go to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet they ſaid all was well and quiet with them, ſo that I was as <hi>David</hi> was, almoſt like to have ſlept, and to have ſaid in my Heart, <hi>ſure there is no God:</hi> But all things comes by Nature, becauſe the Righteous could find no Peace in their Righteouſneſs, as I could not; nor the Wicked were not troubled for their Sins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But when I went into the Sanctuary of my Mind, I conſidered the viſible things of Nature, I could not conceive how this vaſt Element we ſee could make it ſelf; or, how the Sun, Moon, and Stars could give Being to themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62853:14"/>6. How could the Beaſts of the Field, the Fouls of the Aire, the Fiſh of the Sea: I could not imagine how theſe things could give Being to themſelves, nor how they ſhould come by Nature, nor how they ſhould Create one another. Then thought I, Man might as well Create himſelf, and come by Nature as thoſe Things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So I thought there muſt needs be ſome Original Cauſe, or, ſupreme Power, that gave Being to theſe Things, and hath placed a Law of Order in all Things, ſutable to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This ſupreme Power that made thoſe Things; That Power that is the Cauſe of Cauſes we call God; but what he is in himſelf I knew not at that time; But theſe Thoughts preſerved me from ſaying in my Heart, as the Fool doth, <hi>there is no God.</hi> Many of my Acquaintance did ſay in their Hearts, and Tongues both, <hi>That there is no God, but Nature only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. But notwithſtanding I did not know that God that made all things, and Man in his own Image and Likeneſs, yet I conſidered that innocency of Heart, and a juſt upright Spirit, was good in it ſelf, if there were no God to Reward it</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And that Unrighteouſneſs and Luſt after his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife, and not to be of an upright Spirit, it was Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in it ſelf, if there were no God to puniſh it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Therefore I was loth to let go my Integrity, but kept cloſe to it; for as I had been Innocent from my Childhood to this Day, I was reſolved to keep to it to the end, if there were nothing after Death, yet would I keep my Heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and would do nothing to wound my Conſience.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For I never had no Guilt of actual Sin that did ever trouble me.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So with this Reſolution I did reſolve to live in, to do juſt between Man and Man, and to keep from all actual Sin, as I ever had been, and not to mind any Religion more, for I ſaw all profeſſion of Religion in all Men was vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory to all Men, as it was to me.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62853:15"/>14. So I gave over all publick Prayer, and Hearing and Diſcourſe about Religion; and lived an honeſt and juſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life: And I found more Peace here then in all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and if there were anything, either of Happineſs or Miſery after Death, I left it to God, which I knew not, to do what he would with me.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But I was in good Hope at that time, that there was nothing after Death, but all Happineſs and Puniſhment was in this Life: For I ſaw a temporal Puniſhment follow Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in this Life to many.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And I ſaw Proſperity to thoſe that were Righteous, even in this Life; ſo that I was in good Hopes all Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Happineſs would end in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So I was reſolved to keep myſelf as I always had done, unſpotted of the World, and not to defile my Conſcience: And I had a great deal of peace of Mind in this Condition. And in this Condition did I continue ſome three Years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I was about forty years old, and in the year 1650.</p>

And as for <hi>John Robins,</hi> he declared himſelf to be God Almighty; and that he was the Judge of the Quick and of the Dead; and that he was that firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was in that innocent State; and that his Body had been Dead this Five Thouſand, Six Hundred and odd Years, and now he was riſen again from the Dead; And that he was that <hi>Adam Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſadick</hi> that met <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Way; and received Tithes of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Alſo he ſaid, he had raiſed from the Dead that ſame <hi>Cain</hi> that killed <hi>Abel;</hi> and that he had raiſed that ſame <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and now they were Redeem'd to be happy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Alſo he ſaid he had raiſed ſeveral of the Prophets, as <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and others; and that he had raiſed the ſame <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, Jacob</hi>'s Son, that had been Dead ſo many Thouſand Years, now he was raiſed again.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I ſaw all thoſe that was ſaid to be raiſed by <hi>John Robins,</hi> and they owned themſelves to be the very ſame Perſons that had been Dead for ſo long time.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Alſo I ſaw ſeveral others of the Prophets that was ſaid to be raiſed by him, and they did own they were the ſame; for I have had Nine or Tenn of them at my Houſe at a time, of thoſe that were ſaid to be raiſed from the Dead.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For I do not ſpeak this from Hearſay from others, but from a perfect Knowledge, which I have ſeen and heard from themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Alſo they declared unto me, That their God <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> was to gather out of <hi>Englad</hi> and elſe where, an Hundred and Forty Four Thouſand Men and Women, and lead them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> and there to make them happy: And that he would feed them with <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven: And that he would divide the Red-Sea, and that they ſhould go through upon dry Land.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Alſo he ſaid, that thoſe Prophets he had raiſed ſhould be their Leaders, and on <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Garment ſhould be the <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62853:16"/>
Man that ſhould be chief under his God <hi>John Robins:</hi> And that all the Leaders ſhould have Power by the clap of their Hands, and a ſtamp of their Foot to deſtroy any that did oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Alſo I have ſeen one of his Prophets, that ſhould have this Power, to kneel down and pray to <hi>John Robins,</hi> as unto God Almighty; with ſuch high and Heavenly Expreſſions which was marvellous unto me to hear.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Thoſe Things, and many more lying Signes and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders did he ſhew to ſome; as preſenting the appearance of Angels, burning ſhining Lights, Half-Moons and Stars in Chambers and thick Darkneſs, where it was Light to the Phantaſies of People, when they covered their Faces in the Bed.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. They ſaid he preſented Serpents, Dragons, and his Head in a flame of Fire, and his Perſon rideing upon the Wings of the Wind.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Alſo his Prophets had Power from him to damn any that did oppoſe, or ſpeak evil of him, they not knowing he was neither falſe nor true, for this Rule he went by.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. That he, or, ſhe that would ſpeak evil of Things they knew not, they would as ſoon ſpeak evil of a true Prophet as a falſe Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So his Prophets gave Sentence of Damnation upon many, to my Knowledge, for ſpeaking evil of him, they not knowing him, whether he was true or falſe.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And I ſaw afterwards that his Sentence was true up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, for they would have ſaid as much to the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they did to him: So I ſaw his Sentance was true and efe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual upon thoſe he condemned, notwithſtanding he himſelf was falſe.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For this was obſerved, that the Elect Seed would be preſerved from ſpeaking Evil of things they knew not. That belongs only to the Seed of the Serpent to ſpeak Evil of things he doth not know: For who upon Earth did know, at that time whether he was Falſe or True: I ſay none, not one.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Prophets Application conſerning theſe wonderful things, and of his Qualification.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW this <hi>John Robins</hi>'s knowledge in the Scriptures was more at that time than any Man in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe things had I perfect Knowledge of, yet was I quiet and ſtill, and heard what was ſaid and done, and ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nothing that was ſaid or done.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſhewed Kindneſs and Mercy to all of them, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in myſelf what the Ephect of theſe things would be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And one of his Prophets came to my Houſe very oft, and he told me all things that was done amongſt them; and he had a very high Language, and very knowing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſpake as an Angel of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And my natural Temper was always merciful to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and this place of Scripture run much in my Mind: <hi>Forget not to entertain Strangers, for ſome in entertaining of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have entertained Angels.</hi> So I never let him go without Eating and Drinking.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And if I had nothing in the Houſe to Eat, if I had but Eighteen Pence I would give him one Shilling of it; and if I had but Twelve Pence, I would give him Six Pence of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This I did many times, though I had need enough my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for I had Three Children to maintain at that time: Two Daughters by my Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> and one Son by my Second Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> then alive.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. All theſe things never moved me to rejoyce, in any Hope of any Happineſs or Deliverance to any better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then I was then in, or to be in any worſe Condition after Death, then I was in at preſent.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But I kept cloſe to my Integrity of Heart: That is, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62853:17"/>
would do nothing that ſhould condemn my Conſcience, but would do what I could to juſtify my Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Tho I looked for no Reward hereafter, yet I would do well, that Sin might not ly at the Door of my Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And theſe things working in my Mind kept me from actual Sin, and from the Pollutions of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Yet all this while was I as one without God in this World, as to my knowledge of him; I had none that was true.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But the Lord God of Truth, had Reſpect unto my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to the upriteneſs of my Heart, but I knew it not all that time; as will more plainly appear in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               </div>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Prophet here ſhowes of a Melancholy that came upon him, and afterwards of Two Motions ariſing in him, and ſpeak as Two living Voices.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this, in the beginning of the Year 1651. and in the Year of my Life 41. and better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the beginning of the year it came to paſs upon a Day in the Month called <hi>April,</hi> I being ſilent, all alone, my Children being all abroad, there fell upon me a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy upon my Spirit, and I knew not for what; yet I was preſſed exceedingly in my Heart with Fear.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So I began to caſt about in my Mind, what I had done that I ſhould thus fear: So I called to mind all my former Righteouſneſs and Zeal which I had left, thinking in myſelf that might be the Cauſe of this Fear.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Reaſoning in myſelf whether I had beſt turn again to my former Practiſe of Religion, or not.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There did ariſe in me an Anſwer to that; and ſaid, <hi>No, For thou knoweſt when thou did'ſt worſhip in that Zeal thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62853:17"/>
had'ſt no Peace, but was oft tormented with fear of Hell, ſo to no purpoſe to turn or go back to</hi> Aegipt <hi>again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then did two Motions ariſe in me, and ſpeak in me, as two lively Voices; as if two Spirits had been ſpeaking in me, one anſwering the other, as if they were not my own Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But I knew afterwards they were the two Seeds ſtrove in me for maſtery.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So my old Fears of Hell roſe in me, as it did formerly, when a <hi>Puritan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. So I began to reaſon in myſelf, what I ſhould do to eſcape being damn'd to Eternity, for I dreaded the Thoughts of Eternity; for I did not ſo much mind to be ſaved, as I did to eſcape being damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For I thought, if I could but ly ſtill in the Earth for ever, it would be as well with me, as it would be if I were in eternal Happineſs; for I believed the Soul was mortal many years before, which Belief yielded me much Peace of Mind: And was in hope God would never raiſe me again.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For I did not care whether I was Happy, ſo I might not be Miſerable. I car'd not for Heaven ſo I might not go to Hell, but I could not be ſure I ſhould go to Heaven, nor certain I ſhould eſcape Hell which was a great perplexity to my Mind, not knowing which way to help myſelf out of Gods Hands.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now this place of Scripture of <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Romans</hi> preſſed hard upon me, <hi>What if God willingly make thee a Veſſel of Wrath, fited for Deſtruction:</hi> And that ſaying, <hi>What art thou; O Man! that replyeſt againſt God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Shall the thing that is formed, ſay unto him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus:</hi> And that ſaying, <hi>Shall not the Potter have Power over the Clay, of the ſame Lump, to make one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Theſe things preſſed hard upon my Soul, even to the wounding of it. Then I replyed againſt this, and ſaid in my Heart, That God did ſeem to be more cruel than Man, for Man made Veſſels of Honour and Diſhonour of dead ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62853:18"/>
Clay, that is neither capable of Honour nor Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor capable of Pain, nor of Miſery; nor of Joy or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, Oh! that I had been as the Clay I tread upon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a living Man.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But God made Veſſels of Wrath, to bear eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of living ſenſible Creatures, not giving any reaſon why; but it was his prerogative Will ſo to do, and who ſhall hinder him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The apprehenſion of this ſunk deep into my Heart, and brought forth deep Sighs and Groans.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And it was anſwered me again; ſaying, that God hath a Prerogative Power above and over all Life becauſe he gave Life to Man and all Creatures elſe. And as a Man hath a prerogative Power over dead Clay, ſo hath God a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power over all Life, to make what Life he will a Veſſel of Wrath for the manifeſtation of his own Power and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For if all Life were made to be happy, or all Mankind ſav'd, then where would Gods Honour appear, But becauſe the greateſt part of Mankind are made Veſſels of Wrath to bear eternal Torments, therefore it is that God's Redeemed ones ſhall praiſe him.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So that there is a perticular People to be ſav'd, but my Fear was that I was none of the Redeem'd.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And it was ſaid within me, doſt thou conſider the nature of a prerogative Power, that is above all Law; who ſhall diſpute with a prerogative Power that is above all Law, and can do what it will with living Creatures, even as the Potter doth what he will with the dead Clay.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The Prophets further Reaſoning in himſelf how hardly God delt with him; and of his Reaſoning againſt <hi>Adam:</hi> And ſhews how a contrary Seed; or, Voice in him repeld his Arguments.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHen I conſider'd this, I wiſhed in myſelf I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born, then had I not been ſenſible nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62853:18"/>
of Joy nor Sorrow: I did not ſo much ſeek after Heaven as to be freed from Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, I Reaſoned in myſelf wiſhing that I had dyed in my Infancy: I thought, if I were a Veſſel of Wrath, my Torments would be the leſs, than now I am grown to maturity of Age.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the Anſwer ſaid to this, Though thy Torment be leſs than others, yet it is Eternal: This Eternity ſtruck a deep Fear in me, which made me almoſt deſpair.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again I reaſoned in myſelf, ſaying in my Thoughts, <hi>That God dealt ſomthing hardly with me, that he ſhould ſave</hi> Adam, <hi>which brought me, and all Mankind into this Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that I muſt be damned for original Sin, which I received from my firſt Parents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>And that God ſhould ſave him that brought me into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Condemn me that could no way avoid it, neither by Prayer towards God, nor by Righteouſneſs towards Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. So that right or wrong, I muſt be damn'd by God's prerogative Will, and which way to help myſelf I could not tell.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Then I reaſoned in my Heart with Anger againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying within myſelf, <hi>God made him upright, and gave him Power to ſtand, but he did not, but did fall from that Innocency and Uprightneſs, and ſo corrupted his Seed: And ſo by this means do I come to be damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Then was I anſwered in myſelf, as it were with a Voice without me, ſaying, <hi>How wilt thou help thyſelf if God will ſave</hi> Adam <hi>and condemn thee; ſhall not a prerogative Power do what he will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Then was brought to my Mind that ſaying, Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated:</hi> Before the Children had done either Good or Evil, that the Purpoſe of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election might ſtand: So that it is not of him that willeth, nor him that runeth, but God that ſheweth Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62853:19"/>10. In this I ſaw that a prerogative Power and Will of God is not to be contended with.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Theſe Scriptures and Arguments upon them, come ſo powerfully upon my Spirit, that my Heart failed me, and my Hope begun to turn to Diſpair.</p>
               </div>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Prophet raiſeth Arguments more, to give him ſome Hope that he might eſcape Hell; but another moſttional Voice gave Anſwer, which quite fruſtrated all his Hopes again:</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter a while I recovered another Argument or two, which I thought might give me ſome Hope to eſcape Hell: Which was this, I ſaid in my Heart, <hi>There can be no Hell till the Day of Judgment, and except God doth raiſe me and others again I cannot be damned;</hi> hoping there would be no Reſurrection at all, then ſhould I ly ſtill in the Earth for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then Anſwer was made me to this: <hi>Doſt thou think that God would be ſo unrighteous as to deceave</hi> Abraham, Iſaack, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and all righteous Men that believed and put their Truſt in God in hope of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? And if God doth not raiſe them again, then God hath made them ſuffer great Sufferings, and loſs of the Lives of many of them, in hope of the Life to come, and of the Reward hereafter; which if there be no Reſurrection of the Dead after this natural Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And if God doth not raiſe them again they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any ſuch thing as eternal Happineſs. Then to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe did God ſpake thoſe Words, and make ſuch glorious Promiſes to <hi>Abraham, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he would be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> for God is not the God of the Dead but of the Living, for all live unto him.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62853:19"/>5. For ſaid I, in my Heart, if God do not raiſe <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> again in the Reſurrection, then perhaps God may not raiſe me, which would have gladed my Heart that I could have been ſure God would never have raiſed the Dead.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the Anſwer ſaid to me, <hi>That God is powerful, and hath Power to fulfil his Promiſe he hath made unto Man, in that he can and will raiſe</hi> Abraham, Iſaack, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the reſt, at the laſt Day, and will give them the Inheritance he promiſed them in this Life. Conſider,</hi> ſaid the motional Voice, <hi>what an infinite prerogative Power can do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Becauſe God doth not raiſe the Dead daily as he doth other viſible Wonders: And in this viſible Creation thou doth think that God cannot raiſe the Dead when they are turn'd to Duſt, becauſe thou never didſt read he did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>But this know, That God can do that which he never did, when his time appointed is come: For there is a neceſſity that God ſhould raiſe the Dead; and that there is a Day; or, Time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd in God's Will, which none knoweth; no, not the Angels in Heaven, but himſelf only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>Alſo the Reſurrection of the Dead is the laſt great Work God hath to do: And he hath power to do this his laſt Work, to put an End to this World, as he had power to Create this VVorld, and make a Beginning of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>So that God will perform his Promiſe in the Reſurrection to all the Righteous, in that he will give them everlaſting Life in another Kingdom above the Stars, and he will execute that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the Seed of the Serpent, wicked unbelieving perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Reprobates, here upon this Earth, where they acted all their Wickedneſs, to Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>And that none that have loſt their Lives for his Promiſe ſake; but it ſhall be given them Life everlaſting that day: Which if God do not raiſe them again, then is he the God of the Dead, and not of the Living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Then was</hi> Abraham, Iſaack, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>their Faith vain: The Prophets and the Apoſtles Faith vain, and their Condiſion, in believing God would raiſe them again, and he doth it not; their

Condiſion is worſe than the VVicked:</hi> Which thing I was afraid to think of.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Alſo I was afraid to queſtion, or doubt of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Power in raiſing the Dead at the laſt Day, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt of the Seed of the Lord: But I could have been glad if there had been no Reſurrection at all, neither of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nor Unrighteous.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But thought I, what is that to me, if I be raiſed to Hell-Fire. Then I reaſoned in myſelf, ſaying, It is above Five Thouſand Years ſince the Creation of this World, and perhaps it may laſt Five Thouſand Years more; then ſhall I ly ſtill in the Earth a great while before I am raiſed: So that I ſhall eſcape the Torments of Hell for a long time, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have Hope in this Argument.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But I was thrown out here immediately, and my Hope cut-off; for the Anſwer ſaid, <hi>VVhat if it ſhould be Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years before thou art raiſed again, conſider it will not be a quarter of an Hours time before thou art raiſed again</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>For there is no time to the Dead, all time is to the Living; for it will not be thought a quarter of an Hour by</hi> Adam <hi>the firſt Man, when he is raiſed from the Dead; he ſhall not think he hath been in the Grave one quarter of an Hour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Then I conceived if a Man ſlept a ſound Sleep three Days, that is no time to him; Time is known to him that was awake that three Days.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So this yielded me no Comfort, but increaſed my Fears of Hell the more.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. One Argument more I had ariſing in me, thinking to have got ſome Eaſe and Hope here: Thought I, this World hath been ſo many Thouſand Years already, and may be as many more, for ought I know.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And there hath been many Millions of People ſince the Creation, more than can be numbered, and more than be numbered hath been drowned in the Sea and other places.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Sure, ſaid I in myſelf, God cannot remember every perticular Perſon ſince the Creation thereof: Thought I, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62853:20"/>
God may forget me, and not raiſe me again, then ſhall I ly ſtill and be quiet, and be as happy, never to be as thoſe that are raiſed to eternal Joys.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But the Anſwer to this ſpeak, with a ſtrong motional Voice, ſaying, <hi>How wilt thou know whether any is miſſing when God doth raiſe the Dead? How canſt thou tell whether any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon is wanting by Sea or Land that is not raiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>But however,</hi> ſaid the Voice, <hi>if there be any wanting that is not raiſed, God will be ſure to raiſe thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Then had I no more to ſay, nor to plead for myſelf, but muſt yield and ſubmit to the prerogative Will of God; if he would ſave me he might, if he would damn me he might, I could no ways prevent his Will.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And this was my Reſolution, ſeeing the Caſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Salvation ſo with me, that it lay in God's prerogative Will only, I was reſolved to ſeek after him in Forms of Worſhip no more.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But as I had been always kept innocent and upright in Heart towards that God I knew not, and Juſt between Man and Man, and never had committed any deadly Sin to trouble my Conſcience, ſo I was reſolved to keep myſelf free from Sin to the end of my Life.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Thinking that if I were damned meerly by Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Will, my Torment would be the more eaſy.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Here a ſecret Voice ſaid, <hi>Tho thy Torment may be eaſier than others, yet it is eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. This Word Eternity cauſed my Heart to fail within me, yet I reſolved in myſelf to live juſtly, and get as good a Livelyhood as I could in this World, and let God do what he would with me after Death.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. All this Diſpute which I have written before, and a great deal more, it was in one Day.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The Prophets ſubmitting to Gods prerogative Power; immediately wrought in him Peace and Quietneſs of Mind, even to all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in Wiſdom and raviſhing Excellencies.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IN the next place I ſhall give the Reader a little account of the Ephects of this Diſpute, as follows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When I had done this I was quiet and ſtill in my Mind, but very Melancholy, and faint and ſickly with the Trouble of my all Day in this Diſpute which was in my Mind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither could I quiet my Thoughts untill I did ſubmit to God's prerogative Power.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There was abundance more of motional Voices ſpake in me that Day, beſides what I have here ſet down, but theſe were the moſt remarkable to be taken notice of by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; yet it was a bleſſed Day to me, as it will appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by that which followeth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. After this, that very ſame Night the Windows of Heaven were opened to me, and the Fountains of the Water in Heaven were broken up, and the Water of Life run down from Heaven upon me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And the Spirit of Faith in my Heart here on Earth did ariſe up with ſweet Waters of Peace, ſo that I ſaid in myſelf, as <hi>Peter</hi> did in another Caſe, <hi>It is good for me to be here</hi> for I was in the Paradice of Heaven, within Man upon Earth; neither could I deſire any better Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Then was the Scriptures opened unto me, ſo ſwiftly, and more ſwiftly than my Underſtanding could receive it; and the Waters of Life run down from the underſtanding of the Scriptures abundantly: And the knowldge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures flowed in upon my Underſtanding faſter than I could receive it, and yet I thought my Mind was very ſwift.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Then was no ſaying of Scripture too hard for me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62853:21"/>
Then I ſaw that the aſſurance of eternal Life, here on this ſide of Death: it lay in underſtanding the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Then I marvelled no longer at the Fathers of Old, in their expreſſing their Faith in God, and depending upon Gods Promiſes to them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Alſo I ſaw the Excellency of the Prophets Propheſies; Neither did I wonder any more at <hi>Paul's</hi> Expreſſions, when he was wrapt up into the third Heaven, and ſaw things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Neither could I utter the Revelations of the Scriptures as was poured upon me at that time, nor the Joy and Peace I received from the Revelation of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For it brought unto my Mind all my Experience I had formerly, and ſhewed what did uphold me at that time, even a ſingle upright Heart before God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then the aſſurance of eternal Life caſt out all Doubts and Fears of Condemnation; neither did I ever doubt of that more after that day.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Then I praiſed the Scriptures highly, which I had laid aſide ſeveral years before.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then did I ſee it was not in vain to ſubmit to Gods prerogative Will, and to wait in patience.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Here was that ſaying of Scripture fulfilled in me, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.16. <hi>And I will bring the Blind by a Way that they knew not; I will lead them in Paths they have not known; I will make Darkneſs Light before them.</hi> Though this Scripture was fulfilled in Chriſt's time, yet it was fulfilled in me now.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For I was led by a Faith now, which I did not know: That was by the Revelation of Faith. This was a Path I did not know: for I never knew what Revelation was before.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Alſo this Revelation of Faith, it made that Darkneſs of the immagination of Reaſon be light before me, to ſee the Truth of thoſe Sayings of Scripture, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſat in Darkneſs ſaw great Light; and to them which ſat in the Region and Shadow of Darkneſs Light is ſprung up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. This Scripture alſo was fulfilled in me at that time,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62853:22"/>
for I ſat in Darkneſs, and in the Shadow of Death but the Day before.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But in the Evening the Light of Faith ſprung up in my Soul, and the Revelation of it took me, as it were, by the Hand, from place to place in Scripture, and ſhewed me the meaning of it.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Alſo it led me to that place of Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79. <hi>To give Light to them that ſat in Darkneſs, and to guide our Feet into the way of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Here did I ſee that the Day before I ſat in Darkneſs and in the Shadow of Death, but now the Light of Life is riſen in me, and gave me Revelation to guide my Feet in the Path of Peace, where no Fear nor Doubt ſhould ly in my Way, never to ſtumble more.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Theſe, and many more, places of Scripture was ſet before me, and the Light of them ſhined clear about my Underſtanding, and gave me the Interpretation of all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all Queſtions in Spiritual Things that could ariſe out of the Heart of Man, was eaſy to me to anſwer.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the time of the Prophets Revelation, his Satisfaction in it, and his Reſolution to fit ſtill now, and be quiet from Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion. Yet ſhews that Providence order'd it otherways. Of the Prophet <hi>Reeve's</hi> Revelation of the <hi>Raven</hi> and <hi>Dove.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THis Revelation aforeſaid was upon me Six Hours; it began about nine of the Clock at Night, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve of the Clock I got a little Sleep, 'till three of the Clock in the Morning; then it came upon me again, and laſted 'till ſix of the Clock in the Morning: And ſo it did in like manner for four Nights together, ſix Hours in a Night.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I never was without motional Voices opening the Scriptures all Day long, when I was alone, for a long time after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62853:22"/>3. So that I was ſo well ſatisfied in my Mind as to my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs, ſo that I was reſolved now to be quiet and ſtill, and not to medle no more with Religion, but to let every one go on in their own way, for I looked at no Bodys Peace and Happineſs but my own.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So now I thought to get as good a Living as I could in this World, and live as comfortably as I could here, for I knew all things would be well with me hereafter: Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Relvelation ſhould have been benificial to no body but myſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For I lov'd for to be private and ſtill, for my Nature could never indure to be publick. So I thought all was well now I had attained my Deſire.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But when I thought to be moſt Secure and moſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; in a little time after, it made me the moſt publick. I not thinking that this Revelation was a Preparation for God to chuſe me to be a Commiſſioner of the Spirit, to declare the Miſtery of the true God, and the Interpretation of the Scriptures which is Life and Salvation unto Men; whereby I was made the moſt publick Man in the World in ſpiritual Things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This Revelation continued with me all one from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>January</hi> in the Year 1651. and in the year of my Life 41. And in the ſame year <hi>John Reeve</hi> came often to my Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And he hearing me ſpeak ſuch high Revelation, and giving ſuch Interpretation of Scripture, he was ſo taken with my Language that his Deſires were extream earneſt unto God, which he knew not at that time, that he might have the ſame Revelation as I had.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. His Deſires were ſo great, that he was troubleſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for I could not follow my Buſineſs quietly for his ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me Queſtions, for if I went out of one Room into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would follow me to talk to me.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So that I was weary of his Company, yet I was loath to tell him ſo, becauſe I knew he did it out of Innocency of his Heart, and Love to the Things which I ſpoke.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62853:23"/>11. Thus, as aforeſaid; <hi>John Reeve</hi> continued, and came almoſt every Day to my Houſe moſt part of that Summer and Winter. And in the Month of <hi>January</hi> 1651. about the middle of the Month, <hi>John Reeve</hi> had the Revelation of the Scriptures in a large meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So he came to me very joyful the next Morning, and ſaid, <hi>Couſin</hi> Lodowick, <hi>now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I know what Revelation of Scripture is as well as thee.</hi> Said I, <hi>Let me hear what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is opened unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. He anſwered, and ſaid, as he was thinking of ſeveral things; <hi>there f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>iet ſtilneſs upon his Mind, and immediately there was preſented to his Underſtanding this place of Scripture,</hi> Geneſis, viij. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. verſes; Concerning <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark with the <hi>Raven</hi> and <hi>Dove.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Of which Scripture this was the Interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>This</hi> Raven <hi>and</hi> Dove <hi>which</hi> Noah <hi>ſent forth of the Ark,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was a Tipe of the Two Seeds in every Man, and the Ark was a Tipe of the Body of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>For there is two Motions always ſpeaking in Man. Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Body of Man ſignifies the Ark of God; or, the Ark of</hi> Noah.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>The</hi> Raven <hi>that is ſent forth of the Ark ſignifies the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Reaſon in Man; for the Motions of Reaſon goeth out of Man, walking through dry Places, ſeeking Reſt but can find none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Alſo it was the Reaſon of Man that took Chriſt, when on Earth, up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>This Reaſon in Man is that</hi> Raven <hi>that goeth forth of the Ark, the Body of Man, to and fro, and taketh Comfort in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but earthly Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>For as ſoon as ever the Tops of the Mountains of the Earth did appear, the natural</hi> Raven <hi>never return'd into the Ark again, as you may ſee in the</hi> 5th. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>So is it with the Reaſon of Man; That</hi> Raven <hi>when it goeth forth by its motions out of Body of Man the Ark: It goeth to and fro the Earth.</hi>

                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Now what Ruleth in the Children of Diſobedience Hearts but the Spirit of Reaſon, the</hi> Raven, <hi>which goeth out of the Ark, the Body of Man, and liveth upon the Mountains of earthly Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Alſo the</hi> Dove <hi>that</hi> Noah <hi>ſent forth of the Ark ſignified the Seed of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. <hi>And when Faith ſends forth her motions out of the Ark, her Body, they are innocent as a</hi> Dove, <hi>humble, meek and low.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>And when ſhe findeth the Flood, and Waters of Trouble of Perſecution upon the Face of the Earth, the</hi> Dove <hi>entreth into her Ark, her Body, again, and is quiet and ſtill till the Waters of Trouble be abated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. <hi>For the</hi> Dove <hi>cannot fly upon the top of the Mountains of earthly things, as Reaſon the</hi> Raven <hi>can.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. TO this purpoſe, as aforeſaid, did <hi>John Reeve</hi> declare his firſt Revelation, with a many more Expreſſions which he uttered at that time with great Joy of Heart, he not thinking in the leaſt, nor I neither, that it was a Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for God to chuſe him, nor me neither, to be his two laſt Prophets and Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he unto me at that time, Couſin <hi>Lodowick, now I am ſatisfied in my Mind, and know what Revelation is, I am reſolved now to medle no more with Religion, nor go forth after any upon that account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>But to get as good a Livelyhood as I can in this World, and let God alone with what ſhall be hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now he had been with <hi>John Robins</hi> not many Weeks before he knew, or had Revelation himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For <hi>John Robins</hi> Knowledge and Language overpowerd <hi>John Reeve,</hi> before he had this Revelation: Therefore he ſaid, <hi>now he would not go forth after any, upon that account, no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus, when he thought to be moſt quiet, and not to medle with any about Religion; and ſo was I alſo then, a

little while after we were made the greateſt Medlers in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of all Men in the World.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Becauſe our Faces were againſt all Mens Religion in the World, what Sex or Opinion ſoever, as will appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by our Writings and Speakings.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>John Reeve,</hi> nor I, little thought at that time that this Revelation we had given us did prepare us for a greater Work than for the Peace of our own Minds.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But it prov'd that God prepared us for a Commiſſion, and that he did intend to chuſe us two to be his laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Witneſſes of the Spirit, as will be ſeen, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For after <hi>John Reeve</hi> had this firſt Revelation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, it did continue and increaſe exceedingly, that it grew very high in him for two Weeks together.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And at the two Weeks end God ſpeak unto him by Voice of Words, to the hearing of the Ear, three Mornings together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is more largely ſet down in his firſt Book he wrote, Called <hi>A Trancendant Spiritual Treatis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Where the Words of God, as he ſpoke to him, are ſet down plainly, as they were ſpoken to him, the 3d. 4th. and 5th. Days of <hi>February.</hi> 1651. and in the year of <hi>John Reeve</hi>'s Life 42. and in the year of my Life 41.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus I have given the Reader a little hint, whereby he may ſee the ground of things, and the riſe how theſe wonderful things came to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Alſo what we were at firſt, and how we were acted out in the time of our Lives, and of the Experience I had in the Days of my Ignorance, and of my Diſpute with God and my own Soul.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And of that great Revelation I had before <hi>John Reeve</hi> had any; and of the Ravelation <hi>John Reeve</hi> had, before God ſpake to him in the year 1651.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And now in the Treatis following I ſhall only ſpeak of ſome of the moſt remarkable Acts and Paſſages which hath
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62853:25"/>
been acted and dun by us ſince we received our Commiſſion from God.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. That after Ages may ſee ſome of the Acts of the two Witneſſes of the Spirit, as well as their Writings and their Doctrin now in this laſt Age. As they have read of ſome of the wonderful Acts of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the Acts of the Apoſtles. So there will be ſome remarkable Acts of the Witneſſes of the Spirit left upon Record; Which is as followeth.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Commiſſion given the Prophet <hi>Mugleton</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, bleſſed by the Prophet <hi>Reeve;</hi> the great Wiſdom given unto <hi>Sarah Mugleton.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE firſt Morning God ſpake to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> he came to my Houſe, and ſaid Couſin <hi>Lodowick,</hi> God hath given thee unto me for ever: And the Tears ran down both ſides his Cheeks amain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So I asked him what was the matter, for he looked like one that had been riſſen out of the Grave; he being a freſh couloured Man the day before: And the Tears ran down his Cheeks apace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So he told me the ſame Words as is writen in his firſt Book; and ſaid unto me, <hi>That God had given him a Commiſſion and that he had given</hi> Lodowick Mugleton <hi>to be his Mouth:</hi> And ſaid, at the ſame time was brought to his Mind that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Aaron</hi> was given to be <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Mouth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what my Meſſage is, he could not tell: But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if God do not ſpeak unto me the next Morning, I will come no more at thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Which I was in good Hopes he would not, for I was willing to be quiet.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Alſo he ſaid at the ſame time, Couſin <hi>Lodowick, Thy Children are all bleſſed, but eſpecially thy Daughter</hi> Sarah, <hi>ſhe ſhall be the Teacher of all the Women in</hi> London.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62853:26"/>7. She heard him ſay theſe Words, as ſhe ſtood upon the Stairs, for ſhe was afraid of him, that he would rather have condemned her; becauſe he never did love her ſo well as he did the youngeſt Daughter.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But he ſpake not then for Affection, but as the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moved him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And ſhe was the firſt Perſon he bleſſed to Eternity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God ſpake to him the firſt Morning.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It was the more marvelous, becauſe it was never heard this many Ages, that a poor Man ſhould have that Power to Bleſs and Curs Men and Women to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And ſhe believed him, and did grow exceedingly in Experience, and in Diſputes with Religious People; and they marvelled that one ſo young ſhould have ſuch Knowledg and Wiſdom to anſwer Queſtions: So that ſhe did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards indeed become the Teacher of all Women in <hi>London,</hi> in matters of Faith and Religion.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And ſhe was imployed by <hi>John Reeve,</hi> at the firſt, to carry Letters to any that he did ſend unto.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And there were ſeveral Perſons came afterwards to my Houſe, more to diſcourſe with her than us.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. She was at that time about fourteen Years of Age, when this Bleſſing was given her by <hi>John Reeve:</hi> And this was the firſt Morning.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But I was in good hopes God would not ſpeak to him no more, for I was loath to be publick: I would gladly have ſat ſtill and be quiet, and not to contend with People about Religion.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But the ſecond Morning God ſpake unto him, and told him what he ſhould do, as is ſet down in the Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſaid unto me the ſecond Morning, <hi>If thou wilt not obey to go along with me, I muſt pronounce thee Curſed to Eternity, as God did me, had not I obeyed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Then ſaid I, <hi>In caſe they will not obey me when I ſpeak unto them, I have no Power to curſe them, if they will not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me or you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62853:26"/>19. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but you have, as much Power as I have, for you are given to be my Mouth, as</hi> Aaron <hi>was given to be</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. So I went with him to one <hi>Thomas Turner</hi> his Houſe, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Mr.</hi> Turner, <hi>You muſt go with us to</hi> John Tauny, <hi>elſe you muſt be curſed to Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. But <hi>Thomas Turner</hi> was willing to go with us, but his Wife was exceeding Wrath and Fearful, that her Husband would be brought into Trouble by it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And ſhe ſaid, if <hi>John Reeve</hi> came again to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>That ſhe would run a Spit in his Guts,</hi> ſo <hi>John Reeve</hi> curſed her to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. For ſhe looked with Wrath and Fear, as if ſhe had newly riſen out of the Grave.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Tranſactions of the ſecond Morning, and how <hi>Thomas Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> went with the Prophets to <hi>John Tauny</hi>'s, and of <hi>John Reeve</hi>'s Meſſage to him; and how <hi>John Tauny</hi> and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign periſhed and came to nothing.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT <hi>Thomas Turner</hi> went with us to <hi>John Tauny,</hi> and <hi>John Reeve</hi> delivered his Meſſage to him to this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phect. Said he,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath not choſen you to be the Lord's high Prieſt, as you declared your ſelf to be; neither is the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>to be acted over again, as you pretend to do, notwithſtanding you have circumciſed your ſelf to fit you for that Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Neither are you, being of the Tribe of</hi> Rubin, <hi>ever to be choſen high Prieſt, for your Father</hi> Rubin <hi>loſt that Birthright of the Prieſthood, by going up to his Father's Couch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>But the Prieſthood was confirmed upon the Tribe of</hi> Levy, <hi>and to his Seed for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>And here is my fellow Witneſs of the Tribe of</hi> Levy; <hi>which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62853:27"/>
you know your ſelf he is of that Tribe, and God hath choſen him high Prieſt in the laſt Age, and the laſt that God will ever chooſe to the end of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>And as</hi> Aaron <hi>was the firſt high Prieſt that God choſe to be</hi> Moſes<hi>'s mouth, ſo</hi> Lodowick Mugleton <hi>is the laſt high Prieſt that God hath choſe to be my mouth, by Voice of Words to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Beſides,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you are not fit to be the Lord's high Prieſt, becauſe you ſtuter, or ſtamer in your Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Which God never choſe none to be high Prieſt but perfect men in Nature, which you are not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Alſo he ſaid, <hi>You pretend to be King of ſeven Nations, and to gather the Jews, in all parts of the Earth, together, and to lead them to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to mount</hi> Olivet, <hi>and to make them Kings of all the Earth: And that you muſt follow</hi> John Robins <hi>with Sword and Spear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Theſe, and ſeveral other things did he ſpeak to <hi>John Tauny;</hi> and told him that there ſhould never any ſuch things come to paſs, as he pretended unto; and charged him to lay all theſe things down, upon the pain of eternal Damnation, and gave him about a Months time to lay it down.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But he did not, but afterwards went further on to proſecute that Deſign, and made Tents for every Tribe, and the Figures of every Tribe upon the Tent, that every Tribe might know their own Tent.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſeeing this, he wrote the Sentance of eternal Damnation upon <hi>John Tauny</hi> for his Diſobedience of the Lord's Commiſſion, and left it at his Lodging; for he would not be ſpoken with at that time.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Becauſe he had ſhut himſelf up for nine Days, and he would ſpeak with none for that time: But he received it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of the Man where he lodged; and after a while he and his great Matters periſhed in the Sea.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For he made a little Bote to carry him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and going to <hi>Holland,</hi> to call the Jews there, he and one Captain <hi>James</hi> were caſt away and drowned; ſo all his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came to nothing.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Third Morning God ſpake to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> as it is written in that Book aforeſaid; where it is ſaid, <hi>Go thou to</hi> Lodowick Mugleton, <hi>and he ſhall bring thee to ſuch a Woman, namely</hi> Dorcas Booſe, <hi>and ſhe ſhall bring you to</hi> John Robins, <hi>Priſoner in</hi> New Bridewell, <hi>and deliver my Meſſage when thou comeſt there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. So we went to this <hi>Dorcas Booſe,</hi> and ſaid unto her, <hi>You muſt go with us to</hi> New Bridewell, <hi>for we have a Meſſage from God to declare to</hi> John Robins: She was willing to go, but her Husband made a little Demur: Then ſaid I to her Husband, <hi>If you will not let her go, I muſt pronounce you curſed to Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. So he was willing to let her go, for he was ſome Kin by Marriage to <hi>John Reeve</hi> and me both: The Woman was a true Beleiver of this Commiſſion afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So we Three went to <hi>New Bridewell,</hi> and asked for <hi>John Robins;</hi> and the Keeper opened the Gate, and ſaid, <hi>Who would you ſpeak with? John Reeve</hi> ſaid, with <hi>John Robins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Keeper ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not ſpeak with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then ſaid <hi>John Reeve</hi> to the Keeper, <hi>Thou ſhalt never be at Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. So he ſhut the little Gate upon us; and as we ſtood a little while without the Gate there came a Woman, a Diſciple of <hi>John Robins</hi> to come out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saith the Keeper to the Woman, <hi>There is two or three without would ſpeak with your Lord, ſhow them the other Way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. So the Keeper let the Woman out, and the Woman ſaid unto <hi>John Reeve, Would you ſpeak with my Lord? Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I would ſpeak with thy Lord:</hi> Saith the Woman, <hi>He is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62853:28"/>
ſame, and will be the ſame for ever. Thou ſaith right,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he is the ſame, and will be the ſame for ever.</hi> Meaning the ſame falſe Chriſt for ever.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So the Woman went and ſhewed us the place where <hi>John Robins</hi> was: And ſhe ſaid, <hi>Knock at that Window, and my Lord will look out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. So the Woman parted from us; then <hi>John Robins</hi> put by a Borde of the Window, and looked out; and <hi>John Reeve</hi> put off his Hat, and held it under his Arm, and ſaid, <hi>Art thou</hi> John Robins? He ſaid to <hi>John Reeve, Put on your Hat:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>I put it not off to thee, but to him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and hear the Meſſage of the Lord to thee:</hi> He anſwer'd, and ſaid, <hi>I will not, except you put on your Hat:</hi> This he ſaid three times. Said <hi>John Reeve</hi> the third time.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>I put not my Hat off to thee, but to him that ſent me. Therefore I charge thee to ſtand ſtill, and hear the Meſſage of the Lord to thee.</hi> After the third time <hi>John Robins</hi> ſaid, <hi>ſpeak on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſpake, and ſaid, <hi>Thou maiſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I was with thee about Six or Eight Months ago, and thou didſt declare unto me, That thou wert</hi> Adam Melchiſadick <hi>that met</hi> Abraham <hi>in the way, that received the Tithes of the Spoil, and that gave</hi> Abraham <hi>Bread and Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Alſo thou ſaidſt to me, that thou waſt the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>in ſtate, and that thou wert the God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that thou kneweſt the Names of all Angels, and their Natures: And that thou hadſt Power over all Voices: And that thou waſt the Judge of the Quick and the Dead: And that Chriſt was a weak and imperfect Saviour, and afraid to dy, but thou waſt not afraid to dy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Alſo thou didſt deceave many People, in that thou madeſt them bring in their Eſtates, and then gaveſt them leave to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain by degrees from all kind of Food, that ſhould have preſerved and ſtrengthed their Natures: But thou didſt feed them with win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy things, as Aples, and other Fruit that was windy; and they drank nothing but Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>So that thou hadſt full Power over their Bodies, Souls and Eſtates; and ſome were ſtarved under thy Dyet and dyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62853:28"/>
look what meaſure thou hath meaſured to others muſt be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd again to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>That Body of thine, which was thy Heaven, muſt be thy Hell; and that proud Spirit of thine, which ſaid was God, muſt be thy Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>The one ſhall be as Fire, and the other as Brimſtone, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to all Eternity: This is the Meſſage of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>John Robins</hi> pulled his Hands off the Grates, and laid them together, and ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed, the Lord's Will be done.</hi> Theſe were all the Words he ſpake; I was both an Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ear-Witneſs of it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. After this it came to paſs, that about two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>John Robins</hi> did write a Letter of Recantation of all his great matters unto General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and ſo obtained his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty out of Priſon.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And one of our Acquaintance went to him, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him how he could do ſo: And he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>That after thoſe two Men had paſſed Sentence upon him, he had a burning in his Throat, as if he ſhould be burn'd to Aſhes; and that he had a Voice within him, which bid him deny thoſe things he had declared of himſelf before, and he ſhould have his Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. And ſaid afterwards, he ſhould come forth with a greater Power; but he never came forth more with any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all, to his dying Day.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Thus theſe two great Heads, <hi>John Tauny</hi> was the Head of that Miſtery <hi>Babel,</hi> the atheiſtical Ranters and Quaquers Princſiple: And <hi>John Robins</hi> was the Head of all falſe Chriſts, falſe Prophets, and falſe Propheteſſes, that were in the World at that Day; and there were many.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Now <hi>John Robins</hi> was that Man of Sin ſpoken of in <hi>Theſalonians:</hi> Neither will there come any ſo high after him to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Thus the Reader may ſee that theſe two Powers were brought down in theſe two days Meſſages from the Lord.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> When the tranſcendant Treatis was wrote many People more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Doctrin than the Commiſſion. Of the Letter ſent to the Miniſters, and when: How the Children mocked <hi>John Reeve,</hi> called him Prophet, Prophet, and followed him ſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones at him; and how a Woman hearing this followed the Prophet to his Houſe, and was converted to the Faith. Of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given upon one <hi>Penſon,</hi> and its Effets.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this there came a many People to Diſcourſe with us, and asked Queſtions about many things, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and we anſwered them to all Queſtions whatſoever could ariſe out of the Heart of Men; and ſome few were ſatisfied and beleived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And many diſpiſed it, calling it Blaſphemy, Deluſion, and Lys; and we gave the Sentance of eternal Damnation upon all thoſe that blaſphemed againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After this, in the year 1652. <hi>John Reeve</hi> wrote that Book called, <hi>A tranſcendant ſpiritual Treatis,</hi> wherein is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Words God ſpake unto him three mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the hearing of the Ear, and his Meſſage to <hi>John Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and to <hi>John Robins:</hi> Which is more largly ſet down, with ſeveral Interpretations of Scripture, concerning the true God, and right Devil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Never ſo clearly made manifeſt by any, as now in that Treatis.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Many People were more offended at the Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than at the Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After this <hi>John</hi> wrote a Letter to ſeveral Miniſters in <hi>London,</hi> and about <hi>London;</hi> which was afterwards printed, forbiding them to preach any more after the receipt of this Epiſtle, upon pain of Damnation to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Theſe Epiſtles were given to the moſt eminent Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62853:29"/>
and Independant Miniſters in <hi>London,</hi> and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> For they were in Power at that time.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. After this it came to paſs in the ſame year, that as <hi>John Reeve</hi> was going through <hi>Pauls-Church-Yard,</hi> one that he had given the Sentence of Damnation upon, ſaid unto ſome Boys, <hi>There goes the Prophet that damns People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Boys hearing this run after him, calling him, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prophet, and threw Gravel and little Stones at him; ſo he made haſt into <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the Boys left him: And a Woman, named <hi>Elizabeth More,</hi> ſeeing the Boys caſt Stones at him, and calling him Prophet, ſhe followed him into Pauls, keeping a diſtance from him, to ſee where he would go: So ſhe followed him, and he came to my Houſe in great <hi>Trinity</hi>-Lane, <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him, being a Prophet, for ſhe had a great reſpect for Prophets: So ſhe told thoſe things ſhe had ſeen, and ſhe became a true Beleiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. After this, it came to paſs in the ſame year, that I <hi>Lodowick</hi> Mugleton having occaſion to go into <hi>Hounds-Ditch</hi> to ſee my Maſter's Son where I was Prentice, as I went through the <hi>Minories, London;</hi> there I met with one <hi>Morgan Guilliam,</hi> a Man that had been Prentice with my Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And he would needs have me drink with him, that he might have ſome talk with me, for he ſaid, he heard ſtrange Things of me: So I went in with him into the Ale-houſe to drink, and there followed, of his Acquaintance, a Neighbour of his, a Gentleman, as we call them: His Name was <hi>Penſon,</hi> and he ſat down in our Company.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So <hi>Morgan</hi> began to tell me, that he heard that <hi>John Reeve</hi> and your ſelf do ſay, That you have Power to Bleſs and Curſe Men, that do oppoſe you, to eternity? He deſired me to tell him whether theſe things were true or no.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So I told him the Words that God ſpake to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> three Mornings together, as is ſet down in that Book afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: But when I repeated thoſe Words, <hi>I have put the two edged Sword of my Spirit into thy Mouth, that whoever I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62853:30"/>
bleſſed through thy Mouth, is bleſſed to eternity; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I pronounce curſed through thy Mouth, is curſed to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then did he begin to fear, and ſaid, for God's ſake, <hi>Lodowick</hi> do not ſay ſo: Upon that, this mr. <hi>Penſon</hi> ſaid it was Blaſphemy, and that it was the Devil that ſpok thoſe Words.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Whereupon I did pronounce this <hi>Penſon</hi> curſed, and damned both in Soul and Body, from the Preſence of God, elect Men and Angels, to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Whereupon, this <hi>Penſon,</hi> his Spirit was ſtruck into his Body, ſo that he could not ſpeak for a Seaſon.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And the Woman of the Houſe hearing me give this Sentence upon him, and ſeeing him in that Condition, ſhe was troubled in her Spirit and grew ſick, and went up to Bed: And an old Man her Father, being there, and ſeeing this, he railed exceedingly at me, and grinded his Teeth at me.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So in a little Seaſon after this <hi>Penſon</hi> had recover'd himſelf again, and ſaid unto me, <hi>Wilt thou ſay I am damn'd to eternity?</hi> yea, ſaid I, <hi>thou art.</hi> Then he roſe up, and with both his Fiſts ſmote upon my Head; and after I had receiv'd a few Blows; my Friend <hi>Morgan</hi> ſtood between us, and bare off the Blows.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And ſaid, <hi>For God's ſake.</hi> Lodowick, <hi>let us be gon, elſe we ſhall be killed:</hi> So he paid for the Drink, and we departed out of the Houſe, and went to another a little diſtance off.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And immediately after came in the Woman's Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and finding her not well, he asked what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they told him all that was don: He asked where the Man was? They anſwered, They went down that way.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So he found <hi>Morgan</hi> and I together: The Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, asked If he knew me, <hi>Morgan</hi> anſwered, He did know me, and ſaid, <hi>He did not ſpeak ever a Word to your Wife, or to her Father; but that which he ſpake, it was to mr.</hi> Penſon, <hi>which did abuſe him, and ſmote him on the Head with his Fiſts, and your Father kicked at him with his Feet, and he did nothing to them again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62853:30"/>23. So the Man went away quiet and ſatisfied, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his Wife, that the Man ſaid nothing againſt her to be troubled.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But it came to paſs that this <hi>Penſon</hi> was ſick immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely after, and in a Week; or Ten Days after he dyed, much troubled in his Mind, and tormented.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Inſomuch that his Friends and Relations ſought to apprehend me for a Witch, he being a rich Man; but they could not tell how to ſtate the matter, ſo they let it fall.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of one <hi>Jeremiah Maunte,</hi> a great Friend to this Commiſſion: And of a damn'd Man and his Fury; and how <hi>John Reeve</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the People that he might ly down and expoſe himſelf to his Fury, with the ephects of that Submiſſion: And of one <hi>James Barker</hi> his Hipocricy to get the Bleſſing of <hi>John Reeve;</hi> and how he was curſed by <hi>Lodowick Mugleton,</hi> with the Ephects of that Curſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ALSO thus it came to paſs in the ſame year, that one <hi>Jeremiah Maunt,</hi> a young Gentleman, hearing that God had ſpoke to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and that he had damn'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Acquaintance, he came to us to diſcourſe about thoſe things; and when he had hear'd an Anſwer to all his Objections he ſubmitted unto us, and did belive the Voice that God ſpake to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> that it was the Voice of God, and that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was the true God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Alſo there was one Captain <hi>Clark</hi> of his Acquaintance that did truly beleive in this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo this <hi>Jeremiah Maunte</hi> was the greateſt Friend to this Commiſſion, and ſhewed the greateſt Love to it of any all the days of <hi>John Reeve</hi>'s Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But he and Captain <hi>Clark,</hi> their Acquaintance many of them were of the Ranters People; who were at that time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62853:31"/>
high in Imagination, like <hi>Capernahum,</hi> exalted in their Knowledge up to Heaven, as they thought; but this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Spirit brought them down to Hell in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe Ranters were the moſt Company we had at that time, and they to have diſcourſe with us, did uſe to club their Twelve Pence a piece every Week, that they might have Diſcourſe with us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And it came to paſs that one of thoſe Ranters kept a Victualing Houſe, and ſold Drink in the <hi>Minories, London:</hi> And they would ſpend their Mony there.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and myſelf came there, to diſcourſe with them, but there came in many more than was apointed, to diſcourſe with us; and many of them diſpiſed our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Voice of God to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> calling it Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Voice of the Devil, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So <hi>John Reeve</hi> gave Sentence of eternal Damnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many of them, for this their Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; we being the Witneſſes of the Holy Spirit that ſent us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But one of them being more offended at his Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than all the reſt, he was moved with ſuch Wrath and Fury, that he would be revenged of <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and would fall upon him to beat him, ſo that five or ſix Men could hardly keep him off, his Fury was ſo hot.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Then <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſaid unto the People ſtanding by: <hi>Friends,</hi> ſaid he, I pray you ſtand ſtill on both ſides the Room, and let there be a ſpace in the middle.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And I will lay down my Head upon the Ground, and let this furious Man tread upon my Head, and do what he will unto me.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Our Friends, and the reſt, were loath to venter, leſt this furious Man ſhould tread upon his Head and ſpoil him: But <hi>John Reeve</hi> intreated the People to let it be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And the People were perſwaded, and did ſtand of a Row on both ſides, and a vacant Place in the middle.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So <hi>John Reeve</hi> pulled off his Hat, and laid his Face
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62853:31"/>
flat to the Ground, and the People ſtood ſtill; and <hi>John Reeve,</hi> ſaid, with his Face to the Ground, <hi>Now let the Man do what he will unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. So the Man came runing with great Fury, and when he came near him, lifting up his Foot to tread on his Neck, the Man ſtarted back again, and ſaid, No, I ſcorne to tread upon a Man that lyeth down to me. And the People all marvelled at this thing.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. After this it came to paſs, in the ſame place in the <hi>Minories, London,</hi> that ſeveral Ranters and Aſtrologers did come to talk with us: And one Aſtrologer being more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Art than the reſt, would fain himſelf to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deſirous to be ſaved, and would endeavour to get the Bleſſing of <hi>John Reeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The Mans name was <hi>James Barker;</hi> he was a Gun-Smith, by Trade, but very skillful in the art of Aſtrology: There were many more People talking with <hi>John Reeve</hi> at that time.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So this <hi>James Barker</hi> came near to him, and deſired him to tell him what it was that God ſpake unto him three Mornings together: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have heard much of you by others, but now he was glad he had that opertunity to ſpeak with him himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. So <hi>John Reeve</hi> related to him all the words God ſpake: And when this <hi>Barker</hi> had heard it, he ſaid, He did verily believe it was the Voice of God that ſpake unto him: And further ſaid, that he did deſire him to give him the Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>John Reeve</hi> anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>If thou doſt truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was the Voice of God that gave me this Power:</hi> He ſaid, he did believe it. Whereupon <hi>John Reeve</hi> did pronounce him one of the bleſſed of the Lord, both in Soul and Body to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Immediately after he had got the Bleſſing he departed from him into another Chamber, and ſaid unto ſome of the Company; <hi>I have got the Bleſſing of</hi> John Reeve, <hi>but, if any of you will but lay a quart of Sack with me, I will go to</hi> John Reeve <hi>again, and call him a falſe Prophet, and ſay, it was the Devil
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62853:32"/>
that ſpake to him three Mornings together, and ſee if he will curſe me again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. There were ſeveral Men that heard him, ſaid unto him, <hi>That he dar'd not do it:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>But he would, if any one of them would lay with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. So one Captain <hi>Clark,</hi> a Friend of ours, was afraid to lay with him without my concent; ſo he came to me, which ſat at a diſtance from <hi>John Reeve,</hi> (and knew nothing of it,) and whiſpered me in the Ear, telling me what <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> had ſaid; then, ſaid I, <hi>Do you lay a quart of Sack with him to prove him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. And when <hi>Barker</hi> ſaw that he would lay with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he began to repent, and was loath to ſtand to his word: But the Company ſeeing him begin to flinch, they ſcoffed and geer'd him, and ſaid, <hi>We thought you durſt as well he hang'd as do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. Yet rather than he would be geer'd for not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Words, and looſing a quart of Sack beſides, He ſaid, <hi>he would do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. So he, with the Company, came towards <hi>John Reeve:</hi> (And <hi>Barker</hi> came with his Hat off, and put it under his Arm) ſaying theſe Words, <hi>mr.</hi> Reeve, <hi>you have declared me one of the Bleſſed of the Lord, both in Soul and Body to eternity: But</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I do verily believe that you are a falſe Prophet, and that it was the Devil that ſpake unto you three Mornings together, that gave you that Power to bleſs and curſe Men to eternity.</hi> Theſe were all the Words he ſpake.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. So I came to him, and ſaid, <hi>Barker, Thou haſt acted the part of a Hipocrite, both with God and with Man, and with thy own Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. <hi>Thou lyedſt againſt thy own Heart, when thou ſaidſt to</hi> John Reeve <hi>thou didſt believe it was the Voice of God that ſpake to him, and that he had Power to give a Bleſſing to whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived;</hi> whereupon thou didſt ask him to bleſs thee? He ſaid, <hi>If thou doſt truly beleive what I have ſaid;</hi> thou replyedſt, <hi>Thou didſt beleive,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>elſe why ſhould I ask a Bleſſing of you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. Whereupon he gave this Bleſſing both of Soul and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62853:32"/>
Body to eternity: And this I ſay, though thou out of thy Diſſemulation and Hipocricy of thy Heart hath got the Bleſſing of <hi>John Reeve,</hi> ſo that he cannot curſe thee again.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. But I gave not my Conſent unto it. Therefore for this thy Hipocricy of thy Heart, I do pronounce thee, <hi>Curſed and Damn'd both in Soul and Body, from the Preſence of God, elect Men and Angels, to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. And not only ſo, <hi>But thou art curſed in thy Eſtate in this World;</hi> For Sins of this nature are to be puniſhed with a double Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. He was exceeding wrath and angry at me, more for curſing his Eſtate than for his eternal Damnation, he was ſo mad at that: So that he knew not whether he had beſt fight me, or take the Law of me as a Witch, if he did not proſper.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. But my Words and Curſe came to paſs upon him, even in this Life, as many can witneſs; even a poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beggarly Fellow.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Notwithſtanding he was as cunning a ſubtil Serpent as moſt Men in the World: But at laſt a Lawyer which he had cheated followed the Law ſo cloſe upon him, that he ſeaiſed upon all his Goods, and took them away, and put him into Priſon beſides; and there he lay ſome years, and dyed there miſerably poor: Which was the laſt End of him.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Thus I ſaw the Ephects of that Curſe upon him, even in this Life; and in the Life to come, I am ſure he ſhall indure thoſe eternal Torments for that Act of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> What the Ranters God was: And how them and their God was damn'd by this Commiſſion: And of the Reſolution of Three of the moſt deſperateſt to Curſe the Prophet <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Mugle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s God.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this, it came to paſs, at another Meeting of the Ranters in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet, London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was many Ranters that heard what was done by <hi>James Barker;</hi> ſo they conſulted among themſelves why they might not damn us as we did them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now thoſe that were to damn us, were three of the moſt deſperateſt atheiſtical Ranters, that had ever been in our Company as yet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And they thought nothing too hard for them; but two of thoſe Ranters which had been often in our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and had ſeen the Paſſages that paſſed with, and upon thoſe we had condemned: That their God they worſhiped was damn'd with them; for they had no other God but a Spirit without a Body, which they ſaid was the Life of every thing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So that the Life of a <hi>Dog, Cat, Toad,</hi> or any venomous Beaſt, was the Life of God: Nay, that God was in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chair, or Stool.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This was the Ranters God, and they thought there was no better God at all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This God did we damn with their Perſons, theſe two Men that had ſeen many condemn'd by us: The one his Name was <hi>Proudlove,</hi> a notable Ranter, the other his Name was <hi>Remington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. So this <hi>Proudlove</hi> he conſulted with thoſe three deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men which knew nothing of us: So they asked him what they muſt do, he ſaid, this you muſt do.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62853:33"/>9. <hi>You muſt curſe them and their God, and perhaps you may bring down their Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. They ſaid they were willing to do that, and that was but a ſmall matter to curſe them and their God: They made nothing of that.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. So the Time appointed came, and there was prepared a good Dinner of Pork, and the three came ready prepared to curſe us and our God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So <hi>Proudlove</hi> and <hi>Remington</hi> went from us to thoſe Men, and <hi>Remington</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>If you three will go up and curſe them and their God you ſhall have a good Dinner of Porke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then one, the ſtouteſt of the Three, ſaid unto him, pray tell me what is their God that we muſt curſe?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Remington</hi> anſwered and ſaid, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is their God, and they own no other Father or God but he:</hi> And now if you will go in, they be there, and curſe them and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their God, you ſhall have a good Dinner of Porke.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. When they heard this, the moſt ſtouteſt Man of them ſmote his Hand on his Breaſt, and ſaid; <hi>If that be their God, I will never do it, if I might gain the whole World:</hi> And ſaid, <hi>That he was ſorry and troubled that he ſhould conceive ſuch a thing in his Heart.</hi> So ſaid the other Two, <hi>We will do no ſuch Wickedneſs.</hi> So they departed without their Dinner of Porke.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But he that repented himſelf could not be at quiet in his Mind until ſuch time he had asked us Forgiveneſs.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So we forgave him his Sin for that, and he remained very kind to <hi>John Reeve</hi> all his days, tho he did not beleive that we were the two laſt Prophets and Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Alſo this <hi>Remington</hi> was called to an account by <hi>John Reeve,</hi> as one in this Plot; and he told the truth, how <hi>Proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> laid the Plot, and that he did but go with him, being an old Acquaintance: So we forgave <hi>Remington,</hi> and gave <hi>Proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> the Sentence of Condemnation to Eternity.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Diſpute with Mr. <hi>Leader,</hi> a <hi>New-England</hi> Merchant; and of the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s convincing him how that God had a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and how God is worſhiped in Spirit and Truth with Bodys, and that there is no Spirit without a Body.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this in the Year 1653, there came a certain Man, a Merchant, and a great Travellor into many parts of the World; and he was a religious Man, but had ſomwhat declined the outward Forms of Worſhip, becauſe he could find no Reſt there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So he applied his Heart more to Philoſophy and the knowledg of Nature more than Religion, for he thought he had ſeen the utmoſt of Religion, and that there was nothing in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Indeed he was a great Philoſopher, and a very wiſe Man in the things of Nature: His Name was <hi>Richard Leader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It came to paſs when he came out of <hi>New-England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted there, becauſe he could not ſubmit to their forms of Worſhip; and when he came into <hi>Old-England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he heard there were two Prophets now riſen up, who called themſelves, <hi>The two Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So he enquired where he might ſpeak with theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; ſo he was brought unto us, and he was very ſober in his talk, and he propounded his Queſtions with great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The firſt Queſtion was concerning God: <hi>Whether God that created all things could admit of being any Form of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>That God made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs:</hi> And if Man have a Form, then God muſt needs have a Form himſelf, even in the form of Man, elſe them Words of <hi>Moſes</hi> are not true, That <hi>God made Man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62853:34"/>
in his own Image, and breathed into him the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Mind, the Form of Man was the Image and Likeneſs of God, before God breathed into him the Breath of Life.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Therefore God muſt needs be in the form of a Man from Eternity: Therefore it was that God ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man after our own Image and Likeneſs.</hi> This was the true Senſe and Meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and it is dangerous for any Man to deny it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Beſides,</hi> ſaid we, <hi>there is no Spirit can have any Being without a Body, neither God, Angels, nor Man:</hi> And further, <hi>that God that is a Spirit without a Body is no God at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>For we that are men that have Bodies, have power over all Spirits whatſoever that have no Bodies: For it is the dark Imagination of Reaſon in man that hath created to it ſelf Spirits without Bodies, which is none of God's Creation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. When he heard this he conſidered the things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that no Spirit could have any being without its Body.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then he marvelled, and ſaid, Where have we been all this while, that took God for a Spirit without a Body: Oh! how have we been in the dark.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But, ſaid he, doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>God is a Spirit, and God will be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth:</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>His Words were Spirit and Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. We anſwered, and ſaid, Can a Man worſhip God in Spirit and Truſt without a Body? He ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> Then ſaid I, neither can God accept of any Mans worſhip except he hath a Body of his own: For God hath a Body of his own, as Man hath a Body of his own; only God's body is ſpiritual and heavenly clear as Chriſtial, brighter than the Sun, ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Thought, yet a body.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But Man's body is earthly, and made of the Earth, in the image and likeneſs of God's own body, only Man's body is of the Earth earthly, and God's body is the Lord from Heaven heavenly: Yet Man's body is the image of God as well as his Soul as <hi>Moſes</hi> did truly mean as he ſpake.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62853:35"/>17. For this I ſay, that if Man's Body and Soul had been ſpiritual in its Creation, then when Man's Thoughts do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend up to Heaven, his body would aſſend with it, in the twinkling of an Eye.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For the Thoughts of Man are ſwift; and if his body, which is earthly, do but put on Immortality, then his body would aſſend with his Thoughts up into the Aire, and ſo to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Theſe immortal bodies can do, and at the laſt day theſe vile bodies of ours that doth truly beleive, ſhall be made like unto his own glorious body.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For now our bodies are natural bodies, but when theſe natural bodies ſhall riſe ſpiritual bodies, then ſhall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality take place; and theſe vile bodies of ours, that are now mortal, yet made in the image of God's own glorious body, ſhall be ſpiritual and heavenly bodies, even like unto his glorious body.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And becauſe God's body is ſpiritual and heavenly, and cannot be ſeen by the natural ſight of the Eye, therefore it was that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>God is a Spirit, and will be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Obſerve, For as a Man cannot worſhip in ſpirit and truth without a body, neither is that any God at all that hath no body of its own; neither is a Spirit without a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of its own any Object of Faith or Worſhip, for a Spirit without a body hath no ſubſtance: And as for thoſe words of Chriſt being Spirit and Life, conſider they were ſpoken from a body.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. For this I ſay, no words whatſoever can be ſpoken of any Spirit that hath no body: For thoſe words God ſpoke to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, they were from the body of God: And thoſe words Chriſt ſpoke, that was ſpirit and life, was from his body when on Earth: And thoſe words he ſpoke to <hi>Paul</hi> after he was aſſended up to Heaven, it was from his own body.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. So that, without Controverſy, no Spirit can ſpeak at all, or hath any being without a body: And this is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62853:35"/>
very Cauſe that Men find ſo little Comfort in worſhiping and beleiving in ſuch a God that is a ſpirit without a body.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Alſo we declared unto him the nature of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there can be no form without a nature, for it is the nature that gives the form.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Alſo we ſhewed unto him the Perſon and Nature of Angels, and the Perſon and Nature of the right Divel, and the rice of the two Seeds, and the ſecret Miſteries how God became Fleſh, and how the Divel became Fleſh, and many other things which ſatisfied his mind.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. So that he became a true Beleiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit, and ſhewed Kindneſs unto <hi>John Reeve</hi> all the days of his Life, likewiſe his Brother <hi>George Leader</hi> became a true beleiver.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. This Mr. <hi>Richard Leader</hi> grew very mighty in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, both in natural and ſpiritual Wiſdom, ſo that every great Man of his Acquaintance did ſubmit unto his Wiſdom, and lov'd him for his Knowledge; ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it all his Life, but about a year or two after <hi>John Reeve</hi> dyed he dyed at <hi>Barbadoes.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this, in the ſame year, it came to paſs that a certain man, a Silk-Weaver, his name was <hi>Cooper:</hi> He being acquainted with one Mrs. <hi>White,</hi> who was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit: She lived in <hi>Duning hill-Ally</hi> near <hi>More-fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62853:36"/>2. This Man was very deſirous that ſhe would tell him how he might ſpeak with theſe two Prophets; for he had a great deſire to ſee us, and ſpeak with us; ſo ſhe directed him where.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So when the Man came and found us both together, the Man deſired to drink with us, thinking in himſelf that he could talk and diſcourſe better over a Cup of Drink than otherway, becauſe it was his Cuſtom ſo to do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For he thought himſelf very ſtrangly armed with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, thinking it impoſſible for us to anſwer, becauſe he could finde none that ever he had talked withal, Miniſters, nor other to do it,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So we went with him to drink, and he propounded his Queſtions concerning the true God, and the right Devil, and how the Devil came to be; and how a Man may know the Hiſtory of the Scripture to be true, ſeeing they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves in many places, with ſeveral other things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Unto which we gave him a full Anſwer unto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he asked, ſo that he could not make any Reply againſt anything we ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Alſo we ſhowed him the power of the Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the power of the Commiſſion of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the power of our Commiſſion in this Age.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that every Commiſſion had power to bleſs and curs Men to eternity, and that he was no true Miniſter of Chriſt which had not power to bleſs and curs.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For if a Man pretend to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and cannot ſay to him that beleiveth in him to be a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the Doctrine he preacheth to be true, <hi>is beſſed to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And ſay to that Perſon as diſpiſeth and perſecuteth the Perſon of this Miniſter, and his Doctrine, <hi>is curſed Soul and Body to eternity:</hi> If he have not Power to do this, he is no true Miniſter of Chriſt, neither did Chriſt ſend him to preach unto the People.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Theſe things ſtuck upon the Mans Mind exceedingly, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62853:36"/>
he was much affected in Love towards us; and he was elevated in his Mind, as if he would get up to Heaven immediately.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And he thought himſelf ſo ſtrong now that he could drive all People before him.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So he departed from us, elevated in his Mind: He went among his own Company, and thoſe of his own Trade, and he talked amongſt them of things he had heard, and that he had been with two Prophets.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But his Company laughed him to ſcorn: But he in his elevation and zeal to what he had heard, ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Sentance of Damnation to eternity upon fifteen of his Companions.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Some were angry at him and ſome laughed and ſcoffed at him, and ſaid he was bewitched.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It came to paſs that the next Day after he had given Sentance upon thoſe fifteen Perſons he fell ſick, yet he held to what he had ſaid the Day before.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So that his Wife, and ſome of them he had damned ſaid, the Man was bewitched, and would needs ſend for the Miniſter of the Pariſh to pray with him, and give his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whether he was bewitched, or no.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But when the Miniſter came, the Man would not let him pray for him.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So the Miniſter gave his Judgment, that the Man was abſolutely bewitched: But after three or four days the Man got up, and was well again, and told us what the Miniſter had ſaid, and confeſſed that he damned fifteen Men, which was the cauſe of that Trouble in his Mind.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Becauſe he did it without a Commiſſion, not but that I do beleive they will be all damned as I ſaid; but my Trouble was for giving Sentance without a Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For at that time no Beleiver gave Sentance upon any Diſpiſer, but us two only: But in that he confeſſed his Fault he was forgiven by us.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of one Captain <hi>Staſy,</hi> a friend to the two Witneſſes, and of their Diſpute with a Miniſter, proving that God was in the form of a Man: And of the Miniſter's Blaſphemy, and <hi>John Reeve's</hi> paſſing the Sentance upon him, and that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any other God but that Sentance: And how <hi>John Reeve</hi> was threaten'd with a Warrant from <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or the Councel of State: And how <hi>John</hi> replyed, that if they diſpiſed as the Prieſt had done, that he would pronounce them damn'd.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this it came to paſs in the year 1653. there was one Captain <hi>Staſy</hi> in the Parliament's Service, that came to talk with us; he was a wiſe and moderate Man, able to hear and bear Words, but did not beleive what we ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But he heard us gladly, and liked many things which we ſpake, inſomuch that he invited us to Dinner at the Inn where he quartered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So we went, there was of his Acquaintance a Miniſter, as they are called, a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Schollar, and with him an Exciſe Man; his Name was <hi>Ebb,</hi> and the Prieſt's Name was <hi>Goſlin,</hi> and there was with them two Souldiers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe Men being at Dinner with us, Captain <hi>Staſy</hi> put the Prieſt upon Diſcourſe and Diſpute with us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So we diſputed with him concerning God; and when we came to prove by Scripture, that God was a form like Man, according to thoſe Words in <hi>Geneſes, God made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs</hi> the Prieſt pleaded, that was Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhowed him that Holineſs and Righteouſneſs had no Form nor Image without a Body, nay it is nothing at all in it ſelf, but as it is acted forth by a Body.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For it is a Body that acteth holy good and righteous
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62853:37"/>
Things, therefore it is we call ſuch a Man a Holy Man, a good Man, a righteous Man: Now if God made Man in his own Image an holy upright Man, could he be ſaid to Be Man except he had a Body.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Neither could them Words be proper to ſay, God made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs, if Man was made with a Body to act holy and righteous Things, and God that made him had never a Body himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. How then could Man be ſaid to be made in the Image and Likeneſs of God, whenas there is no likeneſs at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, for the one hath a Perſon, Form and Body, and the other hath none.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And if you ſay Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is the Image and Likeneſs of God, We pray will you ſhow us the Form and Likeneſs of the Image of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs diſtinct of it ſelf from a Body.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Then where ever we ſee Holineſs and Righteouſneſs diſtinct of it ſelf, then we ſhall know God, and that Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is the Image and Likeneſs of God without a Body.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And when we ſee this we will worſhip Holineſs and Righteouſneſs for God without a Body; if you can ſhow us the form of it by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then the Prieſt grew angry, and called it Blaſphemy, to ſay God was a Form or Perſon, and ſaid we were Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; with many other railing Speeches.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Whereupon <hi>John Reeve</hi> pronounced him curſed and damn'd both Soul and Body, from the Preſence of God, elect Men and Angels, to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And further ſaid, that he ſhould never ſee any other God in the Life to come, but the Sentance he had paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then the two Souldiers were very angry to ſee the Prieſt damn'd, and they would have fallen upon us to beat us, and one of them took up a great Stoole to knock <hi>John Reeve</hi> on the Head.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But Captain <hi>Staſy</hi> held him, and perſwaded him;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62853:38"/>
then they ſaid they would have a Warrant for us, either from General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or the Councel of State, or from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>John Reeve</hi> anſwered, and if General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Councel of State, or Parliament ſhould diſpiſe thoſe things we declare as you have done, and as this Prieſt hath done, I would pronounce them damn'd as I do you.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So with a great many words more, at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us, and Threatnings wherewith they threatned us. we parted.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And Captain <hi>Staſy</hi> ſeemed to be ſorry that they were no more Civil; but he was glad the Prieſt was damn'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a great Enemy to the Clergy.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Shewing how five Men got a Warrant from the Lord Maior and brought the two Witneſſes before him: Of their Accuſation: Of their Examination: And of their Anſwer to it with boldneſs:</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT a little while after this, as is aforeſaid, it came to paſs that theſe Men did get a Warrant from the Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe we lived in the City of <hi>London,</hi> it was under his Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So this Prieſt and the two Souldiers, and <hi>Ebb</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeman, and another Salſeman, his Name was <hi>Chandler,</hi> a damn'd Man, he lived near me in great <hi>Trinity Lane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe five joyn'd all together to proſecute us, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Warrant from my Lord Maior they came to my Houſe, and they brought the Marſhal of the Citty of <hi>London</hi> and his Men to apprehend us and bring us before the Lord Maior.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And they came up to the Chamber where <hi>John Reeve</hi> and I was, and the Marſhal and his Men took us before the Lord Maior to be examined.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And when we came before him there were ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62853:39"/>
againſt us, beſides what theſe five Men did accuſe us of.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Firſt, that Book intituled, <hi>A Tranſcendant Spiritual Treatis;</hi> the Lord Maior had this Book in his Hand. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a Pamphlet by one <hi>Needham,</hi> ſent to the Lord Maior of his own Damnation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And ſeveral Letters we had ſent to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>London</hi> and about <hi>London,</hi> to lay down their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (becauſe they had no Commiſſion from God to preach) upon the receipt of this Letter, upon pain of eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Theſe Letters were in the Lord Maiors Hands alſo.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And there came one Miniſter forty Miles to accuſe us before the Lord Maior, he came rideing all Night, and came in great Fury and Rage, at the very time the Lord Maior called for us to examin us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But the Lord Maior did not mind this rageing Prieſt at all, notwithſtanding his great Jorny.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But he minded theſe five Men that Joyned in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and ſet them together by themſelves, and us two by our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Lord Maiors Examination of us the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and our Anſwer to him, as follows.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. He asked the Accuſars what they had to ſay againſt theſe two Men; one of them anſwered and ſaid, that <hi>John Reeve</hi> did ſay, <hi>That he was their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Lord Maior ſaid to <hi>John Reeve, Did you ſay ſo?</hi> He anſwered and ſaid, <hi>No. What did you ſay?</hi> ſaid the Lord Maior.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Said <hi>John Reeve. Theſe Men deſired to have Diſcourſe with us about Spiritual Matters, and when I had declared the Truth to them, they called it Blaſphemy, Deluſion, and Lyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Whereupon I did pronounce the Sentance of eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, in that they had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which the Scriptures ſaith,</hi> ſhall never be forgiven, in this World, nor in the World to come.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>And that they ſhould ſee no other God in the World to come,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62853:39"/>
but that Sentance which I had paſſed upon them;</hi> This I did ſay, and this his Clerke ſet down.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Another of the Accuſers ſaid that <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſhould ſay? <hi>That General</hi> Cromwell, <hi>the Counſel of State, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were all damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Did you ſay ſo?</hi> ſaid the Lord Maior, <hi>No,</hi> ſaid <hi>John Reeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>What did you ſay?</hi> ſaid the Lord Maior.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>John Reeve</hi> anſwered, <hi>that we were in a place where one Captain</hi> Staſy <hi>invited us, and theſe Men, being Strangers to us, they would needs propound Queſtions to us, concerning God and the Scriptures, becauſe this Miniſter was among them; and he was the greateſt Blaſphemer of Truth of all of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Whereupon I pronounced him, for his Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and for Preaching without a Commiſſion from God, curſed and damn'd, both in Soul and Body, from the Preſence of God, elect Men, and Angels, to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Upon this he and the reſt of them ſaid,</hi> They would fetch a Warrant from General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Counſel of State, or from the Parliament, to proſecute us.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And I ſaid, <hi>That if General</hi> Cromwell, <hi>the Counſel of State, or the Parliament, ſhould diſpiſe thoſe things we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as theſe Men did, That General</hi> Cromwell, <hi>the Counſel of State, and the Parliament, would be all damn'd as you are?</hi> This I did ſay.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. This was ſet down by the Clerke.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Then ſaid the Maior, <hi>You are accuſed for denying the Three Perſons in the Trinity: You ſay there is but one Perſon, Chriſt Jeſus, you deny the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>No, ſaid</hi> John Reeve, <hi>we owne the Trinity more than any Men, both Father, Son, and Spirit, are all but one Perſon and one God Chriſt Jeſus, as is declared in that Book in your Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Then the Maior ſaid, <hi>Here is ſeveral Notes from the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters which you have forbid to preach the Goſpel, upon pain of Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Said <hi>John, We do own theſe Notes ſent unto them, and if any of them Miniſters we ſent theſe Letters unto have preached
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62853:40"/>
publickly ſince the receipt of them, they are damn'd to eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they preach and are not ſent of God: Neither do they know the true God, nor can they preach the truth unto the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. Theſe Words were ſet down by the Clerke.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Then ſaid the Lord Maior unto <hi>John Reeve, What was it that God</hi> ſpake unto you?</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>John</hi> related the Words God ſpake unto him three Mornings together; <hi>the ſame Words that are written in that Book in your Hand.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. THE Lord Maior anſwered <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He did beleive it was the Devil that ſpake to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then to this I anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Sir, you have ſin'd againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and will be damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Maior clapt his Hand upon his Breſt and ſaid, <hi>God forbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but you have,</hi> then ſaid <hi>John Reeve</hi> to the Maior, <hi>Sir,</hi> you ſay you do beleive it was the Devil that ſpake unto me; I pray Sir tell me what your God is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord Maior lift up himſelf, and laid his Hand on his Breſt: <hi>Oh!</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my God is an infininite incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>without a Body or Perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Said the Maior, <hi>God hath no Body or Perſon at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>hath God that made man in his own Image, who hath a Body and Perſon, and hath made all other Creatures with Perſons; and ſhall he that made them have no Body or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his own?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62853:40"/>9. <hi>Doth not the Scriptures ſay, That Chriſt was the expreſs Image and Brightneſs of his Father's Perſon; and had not Chriſt, a Body or Perſon in form like Man, Sin excepted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The ſaid the Maior unto me, <hi>muſt I beleive you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>That you muſt, or you will be damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Then there was a Gentlewoman in the Court called out, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Reeve, pray tell me what the Devil is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>John</hi> anſwered with a loud Voice, and ſaid, <hi>Thy own Soul is the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Then one of the Officers ſaid unto the Woman, <hi>I think he hath met with you now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then the Lord Maior asked the Accuſers if they would be bound in 40 <hi>l.</hi> Band a piece to proſecute againſt theſe two Men, they ſaid, <hi>They would;</hi> ſo the Clark bound them to proſecute.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then the Lord Maior called for the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was newly made againſt Blaſphemy: So the Maior read this Paſſage in it, <hi>That if any man ſhould ſay that he is God, and that God is no where elſe, ſhall be guilty of Blaſphemy, and ſhall ſuffer ſix months Impriſonment. without Bail or mean priſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Then ſaid I unto him; Sir, <hi>What have you to do with this Act, you are a temporal Magiſtrate, and ought to judg of temporal Things between man and man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. And you are to do Juſtice between Man and Man, in all moral and temporal Affairs, which concerns you to be the Judge of, and you will do well to keep there, for you are not to Judge of Blaſphemy againſt God; nor thoſe that made this act neither.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid the Maior, <hi>muſt I beleive you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>That you muſt, elſe you will be damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. For God hath choſen us two to be the Judge of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, and hath given us power to pronounce Sentance of Damnation upon all thoſe that do Blaſpheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that God which is a Perſon, which you do deny.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he again, <hi>muſt I beleive you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>elſe you will be damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62853:41"/>24. Many things more than what is here written was ſpoke at that time, but theſe were of moſt concernment to take notiſe of.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And when this Diſpute and Examination was ended, the Lord Maior asked if we would put in Bail? and we ſaid No.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So he gave order to his Clark to make our Mittimus, and ſend us to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and he went away out of the Court into another Chamber, and the Clark carried the Mittimus into him to ſet his hand to it: So that he came no more into the Court.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For <hi>John Reeve</hi> intended to give the Sentance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation upon him, both Body and Soul, in the open Court, it being full of People.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But he came no more out until we were led away by the Marſhal and his Men to <hi>Newgate,</hi> there to remain Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners till the nex Seſſions.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. This Commitment was the fifteenth Day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1653.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Shewing how the Priſoners brought Irons: Required Mony of the two Witneſſes, they having none, took one of their Cloaks for a Pledg. How long they were Priſoners: The Bordes were their Bed. And of the Wickedneſs of ſome of the Priſoners, which had a Deſign to have hanged them; and how Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW we being Priſoners in <hi>Newgate</hi> Goal, I ſhall ſpeak of ſome Paſſages that hapend there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As ſoon as ever the Keeper had put us in, and ſhut the Gate upon us, the Priſoners brought to each of us a pair of Irons to put on our Leggs, except we would lay them down three Shillings and Six Pence a piece.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62853:41"/>3. Alſo they ſaid, they muſt have Mony for Garniſh, which did amount to five Shillings a piece in all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ſaid we have no Money about us, but however, if they pleas'd, they might put the Irons upon our Legs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I held out my Leg for them to be put on: I was very free to wear them for Truths Sake, though it was a thing unuſual; for it was the firſt time that ever I was in Priſon before in all my Life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Priſoners ſeeing us ſo willing, they ſaid they would truſt us for Tenn Shillings, upon this condition, that we would give them one of our Cloaks for a Pledge; we ſaid do, take which you will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So they looked on <hi>John Reeve</hi>'s Cloak, and ſaid it was not worth Tenn Shillings: Then they looked upon my Cloak, and took it off my back, and ſaid, <hi>This will do, this is a good Cloak, it is good fine Cloath;</hi> ſaid they, <hi>We will keep this Cloak till you pay Tenn Shillings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. And in Five Days after my Daughter <hi>Sarah</hi> brought Tenn Shillings, and I gave it them, and ſent my Cloak home by my Daughter; for I durſt not keep it there, for fear I ſhould looſe it; though I had need enough of it, for the Weather was cold at that time, for it was the 15th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1653 we were commited, and we were there Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers until the 17th. of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. And the Bordes was our Bed; we had no Sheets, only a poor Flock-Bead upon the Ground, and one thin Blancket at top; and we paid ſeven Groats a Week for this Lodging, and thought our ſelves very well uſed in a Priſon, which thing we was never acquainted with before.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But we were more perplex'd with the Priſoners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than with the Impriſonment it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For there were three Highway-Men, and they were very malitious againſt us, eſpecially one of them, that if I went to the Grate when any came to ſpeak with us, he would lay his Leg in the dark for me to ſtumble at, and ſtrike me in the Neck with his Fiſts, thinking to throw me down.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And if I were but walking in the Hall he would come
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62853:42"/>
and drive me out, and ſtrike at me, and ſay, <hi>You Rogue, you damn'd Folks:</hi> And ſo it was with the Boys that were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: that when I went to the Grates to ſpeak with any, they would ſnatch off my Hat, and paun it for half a Duzen of Drink: So the Boys did.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And I gave them Six-pence every time they did it, to pleaſe them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So that other Priſoners ſaid it was not fit I ſhould be ſo abuſed, and wiſhed me to complain to the Keeper, and he would puniſh them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>No,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>It is not for Priſoners to complain of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. And when theſe three notable Thieves ſaw they could not provoke me, no ways, ſo much as to ſay why do you ſo?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then they thought upon another way, and wrote a Letter to <hi>John Reeve</hi> with the Sentance of Damnation to us both; thinking to have provoked <hi>John Reeve</hi> to have given Sentance of Damnation to Eternity upon them, that they might have had wherewith to have done him a Miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But he gave them no Anſwer at all.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. When they ſaw this would not do, they came into our Room where we lay, with a Rope in their Hands, to meaſure how high the beam was, that they might hang <hi>John Reeve</hi> in the Room.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And as it happened there was four condemn'd Men in <hi>Newgate</hi> at that time, and theſe Men were our greateſt Friends to protect us from the Violence of other Priſoners.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And theſe two that lay in our Room, they pulled out thoſe Men by Head and Sholders, that came to meaſure the beam: Thoſe condemned Men had great Reſpect for us, becauſe we gave them many times Victuals and Money.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Alſo we gave ſeven Priſoners, at one time, twelve Pence a piece, ſo that we found Favor in their Eyes for the Loves ſake.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. There was one Priſoner that begged at the Grate, and when he was drunk, he would trouble <hi>John Reeve</hi> to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62853:42"/>
bleſs him: So one day, when he was very drunk, he broke into <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and kneeled down upon his Knees before him, and held his Hands together and ſaid, <hi>for Jeſus Chriſt ſake</hi> John Reeve <hi>bleſs me, for I am a wicked Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. And <hi>John</hi> went from him, and prayed him to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but he was ſo much the more earneſt for him to bleſs him.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. He was ſo troubleſom to <hi>John Reeve</hi> that he could not tell how to be delivered from him; 'till one of them that lay in our Room came and pulled him out by Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and turned him down Stairs.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Thoſe convicted and condemned Men were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Keepers, which did help the uper Keeper to ſhut up the Priſoners every Night: Theſe were the Preſervers of us from the Violence of the Priſoners all the while we were in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. And while we were in <hi>Newgate, John Reeve</hi> wrote a Letter to the Lord Maior, Alderman <hi>Fooke,</hi> who commited us to Priſon: And one <hi>Jeremiah Mount,</hi> a Friend to us, got it Printed, at his own Charge, againſt the Day of Tryal.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. There was in it, the Sentance of Damnation upon the Lord Maior; and they were given to the Recorder <hi>Steele,</hi> and ſeveral other Officers in the Court: That Letter was Printed in the year 1653. and in the Third year of our Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. There is many Beleivers of this Commiſſion of the Spirit that hath them Letters in Print at this Day; but none will part with them at any Rate, not now.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Two Witneſſes being brought to their Tryal: How <hi>John Reeve</hi> would not ſuffer the Maior, a damn'd Man, to ſpeak: How the Jury brought them in guilty; and of the Recorder's Sentance upon them. And of ſeveral other Tranſactions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AND when the day of Tryal came, we were brought before the Court, and the Accuſers ſtood all Five before us; but the Court asked the Accuſars not one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, neither did the Accuſars ſpeak one Word before the Court.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when the Lord Maior, the chief Judge of that Court, began to ſpeak againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>John Reeve</hi> ſaid, with a loud Voice, <hi>That he would not hear a damn'd Man ſpeak, neither will anſwer to anything; But,</hi> Mr. <hi>Recorder, we will hear you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. So the Lord Maior ſat down, and ſaid never a word more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then <hi>John Reeve</hi> called to the Recorder for our Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the Lord Maior, for that will ſhew all things, and that we will ſtand to.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But there was no Examination could be produced by the Lord Maior, notwithſtanding <hi>John Reeve</hi> called for it three times, but they gave no Anſwer at all; therefore no need for the Witneſſes to accuſe us, for the Examination anſwered to all that the Accuſars could ſay againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the Court waved them, and tryed us only by that book <hi>John Reeve</hi> firſt printed; in which book Chriſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the only God: So they judged it Blaſphemy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Trinity of Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Therefore the Recorder asked <hi>John Reeve</hi> what Father it was that Chriſt prayed unto in his Agony?</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62853:43"/>9. <hi>John Reeve</hi> anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>It was to his repreſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>that he prayed unto; as you may ſee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>when he ſaid</hi> Ely, Ely, Lama ſabatheny; <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> You may ſee that the Jews knew the Hebrew Language; for the Jews ſaid he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for <hi>Elias, let him come and ſave him if he will have him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. So that it is clear, that Chriſt prayed in his Agony, to his repreſentitive Power in <hi>Elias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Then ſaid the Recorder, Mr. <hi>Reeve,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reeve, You have ſpoke enough; let</hi> Aaron <hi>ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Said <hi>John Reeve, Scoff on</hi> Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Truly Friend,</hi> ſaid the Recorder, <hi>I do not ſcoff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Then ſaid I, <hi>I can ſay no more to that one Queſtion than he hath ſaid before, but if you have anything elſe to aske I will anſwer you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. But he asked never a Queſtion more, nor ſpake a word more, becauſe the Examination which they would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the open Court had fully anſwered to all things they could object againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But commanded us to withdraw; and the Jury laid their Heads a little together and brought us in guilty of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and execrable Opinions.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So the Recorder gave Sentance upon us, That we ſhould be ſent to <hi>Old Bridewell,</hi> and be kept Priſoners there for ſix Months, without Bail or maine Priſe.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So there we remained full ſix Months.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And while we were Priſoners in <hi>Old Bridewell, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah Mount</hi> got that Epiſtle to the Miniſters printed, which are yet to be ſeen, and will be to the end of the World by ſome.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. After this, while we were Priſoners there, we wrote a Remonſtrance of all the Tranſactions that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that was remarkable, from the day of our Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1651. to this our time of being Committed Priſoners in <hi>Old Bridewell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. And this Remonſtrance was directed to General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah Mount</hi> got that printed at his own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62853:44"/>
Charge alſo. This Remonſtrance is yet to be ſeen with ſome, and will remain in the hands of ſome to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. This <hi>Jeremiah Mount</hi> was a great Friend to us in the time of our Impriſonment, and ſo was <hi>John Brunte</hi> and his Wife, and one <hi>Richard Ruſſell:</hi> There was very few Beleivers of us at that time, this was in the year 1653. It was a year of great and many Troubles to us both, but eſpecially to me.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And about the Month of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1654. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſeven Months Impriſonment we came forth of Priſon.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And after this <hi>John Reeve</hi> wrote Letters to ſeveral Men; as to Eſquire <hi>Penington, William Sedgwick,</hi> Miniſter, and to the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. And ſome of them ſent Anſwers to him again; but none of theſe Letters are in print.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Alſo <hi>John</hi> wrote that Spiritual and heavenly Treatis, Intituled, <hi>Adivine Lookinglaſs:</hi> And he got it printed in the Year 1656. <hi>Jeremiah Mount</hi> was at the greateſt part of that Charge.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But the Printer being knaviſh and covetous, quite ſpoiled it in the Preſs; he hudled it up ſo cloſe together, for want of more Paper, that no body had any Delight to read it through, ſo that it never yielded the Mony it coſt print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of <hi>John Reeve's</hi> travelling to <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where he met with Enemies, and gave them the Sentance, upon which they got a Warrant againſt him: Of the Notice he had and departed. Of his Treatis, Called, <hi>Joyful News from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> After the writing of which he died.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this <hi>John Reeve</hi> went to <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to ſee ſome Friends there.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62853:44"/>2. There was but Four Beleivers in that Country at that time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And he going to viſit them, having never been in that Country before; after he had been three days there he met with Enemies enough.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But they falling in Diſcourſe with him, they diſpiſed his Doctrin and Commiſſion; ſo he gave Sentance of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to eternity upon one or two of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And they ſtur'd up others to perſecute him, ſo they got a Conſtable to apprehend him, but having notice of it, he departed out of thoſe Coaſts in haſt, and over heated his Blood with traveling to the Waterſide, which was Sixteen Miles: And he went upon the Water at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> at Night, when he was all in a Sweat, and cooled himſelf too ſoon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So he ſurfited his Blood, and drove him into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which killed him: He lived almoſt two Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, but in a ſick waſting Condition.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That ſurfit he got then, was abſolutely the Cauſe of his Death, elſe he might have lived many years longer.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Yet, notwithſtanding his Sickneſs, he wrote that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Piece, a Book called, <hi>Joyful News from Heaven;</hi> or, <hi>The Mortality of the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. This he did in the time of his Sickneſs; and juſt as it was in the Preſs, to be printed, he ſaw the firſt Sheet printed, but his Eyes were dim that he could not ſee the print, not to read, for he died in two days after.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There was at that time three Siſters that were true Beleivers, which he did oft reſort unto: The one was Mrs. <hi>Frances,</hi> the eldeſt, the ſecond Mrs. <hi>Roberts,</hi> the third Mrs. <hi>Boner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. This Mrs. <hi>Frances</hi> cloſed up his Eyes; for he ſaid unto her, <hi>Frances,</hi> cloſe up mine Eyes, leſt my Enemies ſay, <hi>I died, A ſtaring Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. And ſhe did ſo, and he gave up the Ghoſt, and ſaid not one word more.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And ſhe took and cut one Look of his Hair to keep,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62853:45"/>
for a Memorial of one of the two laſt Prophets that God will ever ſend while this World endureth.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. He had a fine Head of Hair, it was black, waveing over his Shoulders.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. So he was buried in <hi>Bethlahem Church-Yard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. He dyed about the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1658 in the ſeventh year of our Commiſſion, and in the Forty Ninth year of his Life.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thus I have given a true Account, to be upon Record of ſome of the moſt remarkable Acts and Paſſages, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which we the Witneſſes of the Spirit hath acted and ſuffered in this Seven Years of our Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Only for God's Cauſe, in Obedience unto the Voice of God, that ſpake to <hi>John Reeve</hi> the Third, Forth, and Fifth days of <hi>February,</hi> in the year 1651.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFTER <hi>John Reeve</hi> was dead, there was one <hi>Lauran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Claxton</hi> who had been a Preacher of the Ranters that came to beleive this Doctrin and Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And he owned it ſome little time before <hi>John Reeve</hi> dyed, and afterwards he asked me to give him leave to write in the vindication and juſtification of this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I gave my Conſent, whereby ſeveral of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in <hi>Cambridge-ſhire,</hi> were brought to the Faith of this Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firſt Book he wrote, the Title of it is, <hi>Look about
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62853:45"/>
you, for the Devil that you fear is in you.</hi> It is in print at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond Book he wrote; the Title is called, <hi>The Quakers Downfall:</hi> Which is in print at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The third Book he wrote, the Title is called, <hi>A Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue between Faith and Reaſon:</hi> Which is in print at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The forth Book he wrote, is called, <hi>A Wonder of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> Which is in print at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. After this he grew ſo Proud, and Lording over the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers, ſaying, <hi>That no body could write in the vindication of this Commiſſion, now</hi> John Reeve <hi>was dead, but he:</hi> And to that purpoſe he wrote another Book Intituled, <hi>The loſt Sheep found:</hi> It is in print to this Day.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Wherein he had proudly exalted himſelf into <hi>John Reeve's</hi> Chair, exalting <hi>John Reeve</hi> and himſelf, but quite excluded me in all the Book.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So many of the Beleivers complained to me of his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them, and that he had excluded me quite in this laſt Book.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Whereupon I read the Book over, and found the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was true.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Whereupon I put him down, for ever writing any more, and I wrote to the Beleivers in <hi>Cambridge ſhier,</hi> and elſe where, that he was put down for his Pride and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, for ever writing any more upon that account.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And the Beleivers did obey my Voice every where.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. He continued thus, four Years after <hi>John Reeve</hi> dyed, until the year 1661. and in a while after <hi>Laurance Claxton</hi> humbled himſelf to me, and acknowledged his Fault, and I forgave him, and took him into my Favour, but ty'd him not to write any more.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. So he continued ſeveral years afterwards, juſtifying his Faith and Confidence, in this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But it came to paſs, when the Fire deſtroy'd the Citty of <hi>London</hi> he, to get a Livelyhood, did ingage to help Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality to borrow Mony, to build their Houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. So he only was Arreſted, and put in <hi>Ludgate</hi> Goal, for this Mony: He lay there a whole year, and dyed there.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But he gave a very good Teſtimony of his Faith in the true God, and in this Commiſſion of the Spirit, and of that full aſſurance of eternal Happineſs he ſhould enjoy, to eternity after his Death.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Shewing how the Prophet cauſed, <hi>The Divine Looking-Glaſs</hi> to be Reprinted: Of the Prophets printing a Book of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the 11th. of the Revelations: And, <hi>The Quakers Neck broken:</hi> Of his Travels to <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and the Tranſactions that paſſed there: And then to <hi>Cheſterfield.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE firſt thing I did after <hi>Claxton</hi> was put down, I cauſed the <hi>Divine Looking-Glaſs</hi> to be new printed 1661. Which was done very handſomly, and is now to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After this I wrote a Book containing Twenty four Sheets of Paper; Intituled, <hi>The Interpretation of the</hi> 11th. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Revelations by St.</hi> John, and got it printed in the ſame year 1662. Which is yet to be ſeen: Never was ſuch a thing extant in the World before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After this I wrote a Book called, <hi>The Neck of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers broken,</hi> containing Tenn Sheets of Paper; and got it printed in the ſame year 1663. Which is yet to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After this it came to paſs, that ſeveral in the North Country, hearing and ſeeing theſe Books, had a great deſire to ſee me, and eſpecially one <hi>Ellin Sudbury</hi> at <hi>Notingham,</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62853:46"/>
and one <hi>Dorothy Carter</hi> of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> in <hi>Darbyſhier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe and others were very deſirous to ſee me, but they could not tell how, for they thought it would be too much Charge and Labour for them to come to <hi>London</hi> to me ſo far; for they were loath to put me to ſo much Charge to come to them; yet <hi>Ellin Sudbury,</hi> her deſiers were ſo ſtrong, that ſhe could not be ſatisfied except ſhe did ſee me: So ſhe wrote a Letter unto me, that I would come into thoſe Parts; and that the Soſiety ſhould bare the Charge.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now I marvelled what that Society ſhould be, but it was the Beamoniſts mix'd with the Quakers; as I found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: But this being in the Winter, I ſent word I would come and ſee her in Summer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And accordingly it came to paſs, that one <hi>Thomas Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> a Friend of ours at <hi>London,</hi> had occaſion to ſee his own Relations in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Notingham,</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his way, he was willing to travel with me, to ſee thoſe Friends we had never ſeen before.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And when we came to <hi>Notingham, Elin Sudbury</hi> was glad to ſee us, and ſo was her Husband alſo, but at that time he was upon the <hi>Beamoniſt</hi> ſcore; ſo there came ſeveral of the <hi>Beamoniſts</hi> People to diſcourſe with me, and ſome of the Speakers of them, and Mr. <hi>Sudbury</hi> he thought they would be able to diſpute with me, though he could not.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But he ſaw they were more weak than himſelf, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Principles of Religion; ſo that he diſliked them, and ſaid, <hi>That their was no true knowledge of the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them:</hi> Alſo he heard me paſs the Sentence of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eternity, on four of them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And one of theſe was very much troubled, and asked <hi>Elin Sudbury, whether ſhe did beleive he was damn'd, becauſe I had paſſed the Sentance upon him,</hi> only to inſnare her, ſhe being but weak, and had never heard ſuch a thing before.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But I, to free her from that Bondage in her Minde, for I knew ſhe had not Confidence enough, at that time to ſay ſhe did beleive he was damn'd: And if ſhe ſhould ſay no, then ſhe would looſe the aſſurance of her own Happineſs, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving

me to be a Prophet of the Lord, and had Power to give Sentance of Bleſſedneſs to one, and Curſedneſs to the other; So I knew the Woman was in a ſtrait what to ſay, and he urged her for an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But I ſaid, <hi>ſhe ſhall not give you her Judgment at all, to inſnare her Mind: I have paſſed the Sentance upon you, and I do beleive without doubting, That you are the Seed of the Serpent, and will be damn'd to eternity, and it matters not if all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, ſhould beleive to the contrary, yet my Faith ſhall be ſtronger than all to keep you down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Then they grew angree, and threatned to proſecute me, but could not tell how to ſtate a ground of Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. After <hi>Thomas Hudſon</hi> and I went from thence to <hi>Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> which was Twenty Miles further, to <hi>Dorothy Carter's</hi> Houſe, a Widdow; ſhe had one Daughter, her Name was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that was a true Beleiver; and a young Maid that was Servant to <hi>Dorothy Carter,</hi> her Name was <hi>Elizabeth Smith,</hi> a true Beleiver alſo.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And there was in that Town, a Man, his Name was <hi>Edward Fewterer,</hi> a Chirurgeon, that was a true Beleiver alſo: Theſe Four were glad to ſee me, for they had never ſeen me before.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But the Profeſſors of Religion, in that Town, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me, there came ſeveral to diſpute with me; but ſome of them blaſphemed, and diſpiſed what I ſaid, whereupon I pronounced the Sentence, of eternal damnation upon Four, or Five Men there.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And they being inraged at it, they thought to proſecute us both; and they went to the Maior and Aldermen of the Town, to ſee what could be done unto us.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And the Maior and Aldermen ſaid, they could not tell what to do in it, ſeeing there was no Law againſt any Man for ſaying a Man is damn'd; but if you bring them before the Maior, and if they cannot give a good Account where there Habitation is, they may be ſet in the Stocks for Vagabonds

if they ſtay in the Town any more than ſo many days: But we did not know this till afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And while they were ploting this Miſchief; we not thinking of it, <hi>Thomas Hudſon</hi> was to go Fifty Miles further, ſo <hi>Edward Fewterer</hi> and I took Horſe, and went a matter of Fifteen Miles, on the Way with Mr. <hi>Hudſon:</hi> Upon this, the Quakers reported, that I fled away from <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> to <hi>Bake-well,</hi> for fear of a whiping, when as we did not know there was any Miſchief intended againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Beſides <hi>Edward Fewterer</hi> and I, came back again to <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> the ſame Night; but none ſought after me as I heard of, and in two days afterwards, I departed from <hi>Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to <hi>Notingham</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>And as I ſtay'd there Three days more, there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy amongſt thoſe I had paſſed Sentance of Damnation upon, how to apprehend me.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For every place in the Country, where I had any that beleived, and that was a Friend to me, there was a many Enemies that ſought to do me harm, only they had no Law on their ſide; but I being of Mr. <hi>Sudbury's</hi> Acquaintance, and at his Houſe, the Maior or Sheriffs would do nothing in it.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And it came to paſs afterwards, that the Sheriff's Wife came to be a true Beleiver unto this day, her Name is <hi>Mary Barker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. So after Three days, I departed for <hi>Notingham</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to my own Houſe: This was in the Year 1663.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Prophet travels into <hi>Cambridge ſhire</hi> and <hi>Kent:</hi> And of his Marriage to his Third Wife, and of his Second Jorney into <hi>Darby-ſhire;</hi> and of his being brought before the Maior of <hi>Cheſterfield:</hi> Of his Examination by the Prieſt, and of his Commitment.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this I travelled into <hi>Cambridge-ſhire,</hi> to ſee ſeveral Friends there, and they were very joyful to ſee me at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Countries round about; for there were a many of Beleivers in that Country.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſtayed there but a matter of Three Weeks, and then returned to <hi>London</hi> again: And a little while after, I travelled into <hi>Kent</hi> to viſit ſome Friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And there was one <hi>John Martine,</hi> a Tanner, at <hi>Eaſt-Malin</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> which did truly beleive in this Commiſſion of the Spirit, and ſo did his Wife: He had Two Sons and one Daughter; his eldeſt Son <hi>Thomas</hi> did not beleive, but his youngeſt Son <hi>John,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> were both true Beleivers; and his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> was very zealous and ſtrong in the beleif of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And it came to paſs, a while after this <hi>John Martin</hi> dyed, and I going thither again afterwards, I took his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Mary</hi> to Wife with her Mothers Conſent, and I married her according to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as I did my other two Wives before.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I had been a Widdower Sixteen years, before I took this Maid to Wife, ſhe was Twenty Five years of Age when I married her, and I was about Fifty Three years old when I took her to Wife: She was of a good meek innocent and juſt Nature, beſides the ſtrong Faith and Zeal ſhe had in this Commiſſion of the Spirit; ſo that ſhe was very ſutable, both i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſpiritual, and temporal Qualifications unto my Nature.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62853:48"/>6. After this, it came to paſs, the ſame year that I was married, great Troubles did befal me, both upon a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal Account, as may be underſtood in the following Relation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It came to paſs, that one <hi>Richard Hatter,</hi> a true Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had ſome Buſineſs at Law, at the Aſſizes at <hi>Yorke:</hi> He had a mind to go by <hi>Notingham</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> to ſee thoſe Friends there; and if I would go with him, he would bear me Company ſo far.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now theſe Friends, had greatly deſired me to come down into the Country to ſee them; ſo I was glad of his Company, and we jornyed together; but Mr. <hi>Hatter</hi> ſtay'd But one Night at <hi>Notingham,</hi> and went his way and left me there at Mr. <hi>Sudbury's,</hi> and I ſtayed there a few days: And in that time there came ſeveral Quakers, Beamonites, and Indipendants, religious Men and Women, to diſcourſe and diſpute with me.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But ſeveral of them diſpiſed, and blaſphemed againſt what I ſaid, whereby I gave Sentance of eternal Damnation, in that they had ſinn'd againſt the Holy Ghoſt, a Sin which God will not forgive: Which made them very angry, and ſpread it abroad the Country, where ever I was known. And after a few days I went form <hi>Notingham</hi> to <hi>Cheſterfield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And in the middle of the way, there is a Market Town, called <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and there I uſed to bait my Horſe and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that Town is full of <hi>Quakers;</hi> and when I did Inn there, the <hi>Quakers</hi> and others, they would preſs into the Room where I was, to ſee me and talk with me: And they being an obſtinate, and ſtiffnecked People againſt a perſonal God, many of them came under the Sentence of Damnation at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and they had reported it at <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> before I could come there.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And when I came to <hi>Dorothy Carter's</hi> Houſe; after I had been two or three days there, came ſeveral Perſons to ſpeak with me in that Town, being a Market Town, and they were wicked Diſpiſers of a perſonal God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And ſeveral of them were damn'd, at <hi>Mansfield</hi> and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62853:49"/>
                     <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> and about twelve: But theſe at <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> were moſt of them <hi>Independants,</hi> and they conſulted with the Prieſt of the Pariſh, with the Maior and Aldermen of the Town to perſecute me; and the <hi>Quakers</hi> were glad the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> People did ſo.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So the Prieſt being a more ſubtil Serpent than all the Beaſts of the Feild, he conſulted the Maior and Aldermen, to ſend a Conſtable for me, before them, and he would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min me, and ſee what Words he could get out of me, to have Matter to accuſe me of, For, ſaid he, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him for ſaying a Man is damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So the Conſtable was commanded to fetch me before the Maior, and he came where I was, and ſaid I muſt go before the Maior.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. I asked him if he had any Warrant for me; he ſaid, <hi>No,</hi> then I ſaid, <hi>I will not go:</hi> Said he, <hi>I can command Aide;</hi> then he commanded the Man of the Houſe, where my Horſe was at graſs, but the Man was loth to do it, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him in the Kings Name to aide him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So the Man took hold of one Arm, and the Conſtable by the other, and led me to the Hall, where the high Prieſt ſat, for he was one of the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> with the Maior and Aldermen of the Town, and the Town Clarke, and all the Officers of the Town, were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. My Examination before them was as follows; the Prieſt's Name was <hi>John Gupe,</hi> the Maiors Name <hi>John Allwood,</hi> the Recorders Name was <hi>Needham,</hi> and the Conſtables Name was <hi>Slater,</hi> and the Aldermen, one was <hi>Clarke,</hi> and another his Name was <hi>Pinder;</hi> the reſt I did not know their Names.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The firſt thing the Prieſt asked was, <hi>what I came into that Country for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. I ſaid, <hi>I came to viſit ſome Friends at</hi> Notingham, <hi>and</hi> Cheſterfield, <hi>and that I was ſent for:</hi> He asked me where I lived. I ſaid <hi>at London,</hi> and what Trade I was of, I ſaid, <hi>a Tailor by Trade, and that I lived in</hi> Trinity Lane, <hi>and had fined for moſt Offices in the Pariſh were I lived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62853:49"/>20. Then he waved that, becauſe he thought I was no Houſekeeper, but a Lodger, that hath no certain abiding place, but as a Vagabond that goeth to and fro and hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideing every where, So when he ſaw he could do nothing here then he asked me whether I did beleive the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. I anſwered, <hi>No, I did beleive there was three Names, or Titles, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but one Perſon, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. He rejoyced at this before the Maior, and ſaid, <hi>this was enough,</hi> and cauſed the Recorder to ſet it down, the ſame words.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Then he asked me if I was one of the Two Witneſſes ſpoken of in the 11th. of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. I anſwered and ſaid, <hi>I was one of thoſe Two Witneſſes of the Spirit, ſpoken of in the</hi> 11th. <hi>of the</hi> Revelations; then he commanded the Recorder to ſet theſe words down.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Again, he asked me, if I had power to damn and to ſave.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. I anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>I had power to give Sentance of Damnation upon thoſe that diſpiſed my Doctrin that I declare, and to pronounce the Sentance of Salvation upon thoſe that truly beleive it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. And that you may know that I have Power, I do pronounce you <hi>Curſed and Damn'd both Soul and Body from the preſence of God, elect Men and Angels to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Then was the Prieſt ſtruck dumb for a ſeaſon, and when he had recovered himſelf to his Sences again, he ſaid to the Recorder, ſet that down, but did not mention a word that the Prieſt was damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Then ſaid the Maior, Mr. <hi>Mugleton, we do not beleive you, we do beleive the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. I anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>That will do you but little good now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. Thoſe words the Recorder was commanded to ſet down.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. There were many more Words and Circumſtances in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62853:50"/>
the Examination, but theſe were the main things they made a Charge againſt me.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Shewing that the Prophet proved before the Prieſt, Maior, and Aldermen, that Chriſt was the only God. The Prieſt made no Replycation againſt it, but fauning upon him with fine Words, to inſnare him againſt the Government: The Prophet's Wiſdom diſcover'd it. Of his Commitment.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT this I obſerved, that after I had given the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Damnation upon the Prieſt, he was very meek and moderate, and asked me Queſtions in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning Chriſt being the only God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I opened unto him the Firſt of <hi>John, In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word became Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>was not Chriſt the Word become Fleſh, and that Word that became Fleſh was God: And did any other God dwell among Men but Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And is it not ſaid in Scripture, <hi>That in him all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily,</hi> Not a part, or a piece of the Godhead, but all the fulneſs dwelt bodily in him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Great is the Miſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, beleived on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now was not this Chriſt manifeſt in the Fleſh? Was not he preached unto the Gentles, and beleived on in the World? And was not he received up into Glory? So that Chriſt muſt needs be God become Fleſh, and God manifeſt in Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Alſo, was not this Jeſus Chriſt that <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt,</hi> the <hi>Begining</hi> and the <hi>End,</hi> he that was Dead and is Alive for ever more.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:62853:50"/>8. Here you ſee the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> was dead; And was not the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega God?</hi> And you ſee by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> was dead: And was there any <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> that dyed but Jeſus Chriſt? And was there any <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> that quickened out of Death to Life again, but Chriſt? Therefore he is ſaid to be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Therefore it muſt needs be, that Chriſt is God become Fleſh, and manifeſt in Fleſh; and he it was that dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; and he was in the Perſon of a Man, in all things like unto Man, Sin excepted.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So that God is but one Perſon in Form, like a Man, and not Three Perſons, as Men do vainly imagine.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But when he heard theſe ſayings of mine, he replyed nothing againſt it, but ſeemed to faun upon me, and ſpeak ſoftly unto me, tempting me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And asked me ſecretly what I thought of this preſent Power, that he might have had ſome what to accuſe me of, that the Law would have taken hold of.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But I anſwered him, and ſaid, That I never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with no temporal Powers, neither did I meddle with them at all.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So when the Prieſt ſaw he could get nothing out of me, concerning the Goverment of the Nation, then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the things before mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And he cauſed the Recorder to read over the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the Maior; the things were but few.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Firſt, denying the Three Perſons in the Trinity: Secondly, That I ſaid I was one of thoſe two Witneſſes ſpoken of in the 11th. of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Thirdly, That I ſaid I had power to damn and ſave: And Fourthly, that I ſaid their beleiving the Scriptures would do them little good now.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thoſe were the chief things I was charged with. Then the Prieſt asked me if I would be Priſoner that Night at the Conſtables Houſe, at my own charge, or at the Town charge.</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62853:51"/>18. If I had ſaid at the Town charge, then I muſt have lain in the Cage all Night; but I anſwered and ſaid, <hi>At my own Charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. But I ſaid to the Maior, Do you not take Bail in theſe caſes? The Maior ſaid, <hi>Yes:</hi> But the Prieſt, before the Maior had perfectly ſpoken, ſaid, <hi>if you can put in Bail that are not excommunicated Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Then <hi>Dorothy Carter,</hi> my Friend, being a Widdow, would have been Bail, with one of her Sons, and ſhe preſſed at the Door to come in, but the Prieſt thruſt her out, and ſaid, <hi>She was an excommunicated Perſon, neither ſhould the Maior accept of her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. And I had never a Friend more in that Town, but one <hi>Edward Fewterer,</hi> but he was not in the way at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo could not procure Bail.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But was committed into the Conſtables Hands that Night; and as ſoon as ever I was committed Priſoner into his Hands, to be ſent to <hi>Darby</hi> Goale the next Morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sixteen long Miles from <hi>Cheſterfield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Then the Baylies of the Town ſeezed upon my Horſe for the Lord of the Mannor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſent me to the Goal upon their own Horſe.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But I was more troubled for the Horſe than for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe my Friend <hi>John Brante</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> was ingaged for the Horſe, elſe pay four Pounds.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. But my Friend <hi>Dorothy Carter,</hi> ſhe went to the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> he being Lord of the Mannor; and ſhe told him what theſe Baylies had done.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So the Earle ſent for them, and was angry with them, and did reprove them, and ſaid, <hi>Will you take away a Man's Horſe before he be Convicted and Condemn'd? I charge you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that the Horſe be put to Graſs, and that no Saddle be put upon his Back, and let the Owner pay for his Meat, if he be quit, or otherwiſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Prieſt gave that Character of the Prophet, of a wiſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man The Prophet, gave the like Character on <hi>Pendor.</hi> Of a Diſpute between the Prophet, and two of the Officers of the Town and the Keeper of the Perſon, and the Sheriff's Men. The Prophet proves Three Records on Earth to anſwer the Three Records in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All this in the Goal.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW I ſhall ſpeak of ſomthing of my Impriſonment in <hi>Darby</hi> Goal, which is as follows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For all the Prieſt's Malice towards me, yet he could ſay to the Aldermen, when I was gone, That this Man was the ſobereſt, wiſeſt Man of a Phanatick that ever he talked with; for he thought I had been like the Quakers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This did one of the Aldermen tell me, for he was as <hi>Nicodemas,</hi> his Name was <hi>Pendor;</hi> he came to me by Night, for he had a great deſire to talk with me alone, ſo that Night I was in the Conſtables Houſe he had his deſired Oppertuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when I was Priſoner in <hi>Darby</hi> Goal, there came the Sheriff's Men, and Two of the Officers of the Town, and the Keeper of the Priſon, to talk with me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Officers of the Town came to me, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe and knowing enough in the Scriptures, eſpecially one of them, for to talke or diſpute with me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the Sheriff's Men came on purpoſe to inſnare me, if they could; ſo one of them, the moſt ſurly angrieſt Man of them, asked me, ſaying, <hi>Have you taken the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Supremacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I anſwered and ſaid, <hi>That Prophets do not uſe to ſwear:</hi> Did you ever read in Scripture <hi>that Kings have been ſubject to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62853:52"/>
Prophets Words, and thoſe Kings were happy that were obedient to the voice of Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Why, ſaid he, <hi>are you a Prophet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Yea, ſaid I, <hi>that I am a Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Then ſaid he, <hi>do you go to Church to hear our Miniſters.</hi> At that time there was a Law to perſecute Men that did not come to Church, which cauſed him to ask that Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I anſwered him, and ſaid, <hi>That it is not the practice of Prophets to go to Church to learn of your Miniſters, the Miniſters ought to hear Prophets and learn of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>For Prophets were always above Biſhops and Miniſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. When he heard me anſwer him ſo confidently, and with Authority as from Heaven, he ſaid no more.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And when the Officers of that Town heard me anſwer him ſo poſitive, they were the more afraid to enter into a Diſpute with me.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Yet one of them being more Atheiſtical, being of the Saduce Spirit, upon whoſe Wiſdom and Knowledge they all depended upon; he was a moderate Man, and asked his Queſtiens moderately, as you ſhall hear.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Saith he, Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mugleton,</hi> you ſay thers is Three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, or Records to be acted upon this Earth, and you ſay your Commiſſion is the Commiſſion of the Spirit, and the laſt: Now, ſaith he, if you could prove this by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhould be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. I anſwered, and ſaid unto him, will you beleive me, if I do prove it by Scripture, here before theſe People.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Then ſaid he, <hi>truly I think I ſhall beleive you, if you prove it by Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Then the Keeper, and all the Men, were ſilent, and ſpeak not a word, none but he and I.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Then ſaid I, you ſhall not be troubled with any more Scriptures than that in the Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> the 5th. Chapter, and ſuch Scriptures as do allude to the ſame purpoſe; where it is ſaid, <hi>There is Three that bare Record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Word, and Spirit, and theſe Three are one: And there are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62853:52"/>
Three that bare Record on Earth, the Water, Blood, and Spirit, and theſe Three agree in one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Said I, here you ſee that there is Three Records to be upon Earth, anſwerable to the Three Records in Heaven; and as the Three Records in Heaven were but one God, though called Father, Word, and Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So likewiſe the Three Records on Earth, of Water, Blood, and Spirit, are ſaid yet do agree in one, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, do you beleive this?</p>
                  <p n="23">23. He anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>he did,</hi> and ſo they ſaid all.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Then, ſaid I, you ſee this one God in Heaven is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father, Word, and Spirit, yet but one God; yet ſaid to be Three that bare Record in Heaven, yet but one God.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Said I, how will you interpret this Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. He anſwered and ſaid, <hi>he knew not how,</hi> but deſired me to unfold it.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Then ſaid I, theſe Three that bare Record in Heaven, it was ſpoken in relation to the Three Records on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For this one God bearing Three Records in Heaven, would have ſignified but little unto Mankind, had there not been Three Records on this Earth given unto Men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto Men the Three Records in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That Men might underſtand that one true God that is in Heaven, demonſtrated by Three Titles, of Father, Word, and Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Which God cannot be known, but by the Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords on Earth, and thoſe Three Records on Earth muſt be acted by Men, that Men and Women may come to know that one true God in Heaven, which is diſtinguiſhed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Word, and Spirit, and be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. For it is Life eternal to know the true God, and he is to be known no other way, but by theſe Three Records on Earth, of Water, Blood, and Spirit; and theſe Three Records on Earth are acted by Men, <hi>be they not,</hi> ſaid I. He ſaid, <hi>yea.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Shewing the Interpretations of the Two paſt Records on Earth, of Water and Blood, being undeniably unfolded.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THEN, ſaid I, will you interprit who thoſe Men were and are, that have acted the Records of Water and Blood and Spirit upon Earth?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He anſwered and ſaid, <hi>No, he could not,</hi> but deſired me to interprit it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then, ſaid I, the Interpretation is thus; the Record of Water upon the Earth it was <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They worſhiped God with divers Ceremonies of Tipes and Offerings of Bulls and Goates, and ſprinkled upon the Alter their Blood, and upon the Fleſh of the Leapers, and other diſtempered Perſons that were unclean, and much Waſhings and Purifyings with clear Water, was uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Worſhip of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Which was the Record of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, it being ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi> and practiſed by the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> many Generations: And this Record of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon Earth is that Record of Water, anſwering and bearing Teſtimony to that one God the Father and Creator of all things both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This is the Interpretation of the Record of Water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and this agreeth with the Record of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now you muſt underſtand that the Record of Water upon Earth, it was acted by Men, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the high Prieſts, in the time of the Law: They all cryed with one accord, <hi>This is Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Interpretation of the Record of the Blood upon Earth, it was Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, In that Chriſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62853:53"/>
came to fulfil the Law, and he is ſaid to be the end of the Law to every one that beleives, and to lay down his Life for many.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now, in laying down his Life, is underſtood that he ſhed his own precious Blood: Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>his Soul was heavy unto Death and he power'd out his Soul unto Death; and except you eat my Fleſh and drink my Blood you have no Life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. That is, no Man hath the Aſſurance of eternal Life, abideing in him, except he doth truly beleive that Fleſh of Chriſt that was Crucified upon the Croſs, to be the Fleſh of God.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That is, the Word became Fleſh and dwelt amongſt Men, and that Blood of Chriſt that was power'd out unto Death, to be the Blood of God: Except this be beleived there can be no eternal Life abideing in Man.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For this Blood of Chriſt doth purge the Conſcience from dead Works, to ſerve the living God: So that Chriſt which is manifeſt in Fleſh, as the Scripture ſaith, did paſs through Blood.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And his Apoſtles, after he had given them a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as in the Second of the <hi>Acts,</hi> they bare Teſtimony and Record on the Earth, that Jeſus was the Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And they did witneſs, that he ſhed his Blood, and was put to Death by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and did riſe again and aſſend up into Heaven, in that ſame Body he ſuffered Death in.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For which Record of theirs they were put to Death, and their Blood was ſhed, and ſo were many Beleivers in their Commiſſion put to Death, and paſſed through Blood, for bearing Record to this Jeſus which they had cruſified, to be the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And this Record on Earth was acted by Men, who loſt their Lives for their Record; therefore it is called the Record of Blood upon Earth.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Anſwerable to the Record in Heaven, in that the Word became Fleſh; and Chriſt is that Word that bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven, and became Fleſh, and ſhed his Blood:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62853:54"/>
And thoſe that bare Record unto him, their Blood was ſhed alſo.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So that the Blood of Chriſt, and the Blood of the Apoſtles, and the Blood of Saints, is that Record of Blood on Earth: And this Record of Blood on Earth, it was acted by Men, by Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and Saints.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. This is the true Interpretation of the Second Record of Blood here upon Earth, is it not ſaid I.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. They all rejoyced, and ſaid it was true ſo far, and that they never hear'd the like.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Now the Interpretation of the Third Record of the Spirit upon Earth: You ſee, ſaid I, that there is to be Three Records upon Earth, as there is Three in Heaven: Now you ſee there is but Two acted upon Earth as yet, to wit, Water and Blood.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Now the Water Record was to witneſs to God the Father, the Blood Record witneſſed to Chriſt the Son, and you ſee they were Men like your ſelves, that did bear theſe Records on Earth, of Water and Blood.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Likewiſe, you ſee, that theſe Two Records on Earth, they did witneſs to one God in Heaven: <hi>Did they not?</hi> ſaid I. He anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>They did.</hi> Yet, ſaid I, you ſee they differ one from the other in point of Worſhip, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they did agree to bear Record to one God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Now, ſaid I, as theſe Two Records of Water and Blood were acted upon Earth by Men, ſo likewiſe muſt the Record of the Spirit upon Earth he acted by Men alſo.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And not as People do vainly imagiin, That the Two former Records were acted by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the High Prieſts, which were Men: And the Record of the Blood was acted upon this Earth by Chriſt and his Apoſtles and Saints, which were Men.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But you cannot conceive the Record of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth is to be acted by Men, as the other Two were: But you conceive that God doth act this Record upon Earth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62853:54"/>
himſelf, only by inſpiring his Spirit into every Mans Heart ſecretly giving the Knowledge of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Two anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>Indeed this was their Beleif</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. But, ſaid I, the Record of the Spirit upon Earth muſt be acted by Men, as the other Two were, elſe them Words be not true, <hi>That there is Three that bare Record on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. For if God which is in Heaven doth act the Record of the Spirit himſelf, and Men acted the other Two, then there is but Two Records on Earth, and Four Records in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. When they heard this, they rejoyced, and ſaid to the Man that diſputed with me, Mr. <hi>Benet, We think you have met with one that is two harde for you now.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>The Interpretation of the Third Record on Earth, the Record of the Spirit, and who it is acted by.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THEN, ſaid I, The Record of the Spirit upon Earth muſt be acted by Men, as the other Two were. Now, ſaid I, there muſt be Witneſſes of the Spirit upon Earth, as there was Witneſſes of Water and Blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſome Men muſt be the chief Teachers or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles; theſe were choſen of God, and happy was it for thoſe that beleived them in their time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now, ſaid I, God choſe <hi>John Reeve</hi> and myſelf by Voice of Words, to the hearing of the Ear, to be his Two laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Witneſſes of the Spirit, and he gave us Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his Mind in the Scriptures above all the Men in the World at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And this I know to be true, and many that can witneſs the ſame: I ſpake not this out of any Pride of Heart, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62853:55"/>
out of perfect Knowledge, for true Knowledge is never proud.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For I would make nothing of the greateſt learned Man that is upon the Earth, if he will diſpute of the Scripture in the <hi>Engliſh Tongue:</hi> And not perſecute with a <hi>Sword of Steel,</hi> to overthrow him by the Scriptures, that there is but one true God in the perſon of a Man, who made Man in his own <hi>Image</hi> and likeneſs, as the Scriptures ſaith; And not Three Perſons, and one God, as all Profeſers of Reaſon do own at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Alſo we being the third Record of the Spirit upon Earth, we uſe no outward viſible Forms of Worſhip, But do Worſhip God in Spirit, and Truth, as Chriſt ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So that every Record on Earth, doth differ, one from another, in Point of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For it is not proper, for every Record, to Act one and the ſame thing, over and over again: And as there is a difference in the Three Titles called Three Records in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of <hi>Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Word, and Spirit;</hi> Now theſe are Three Diſtinct Titles, yet but one God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So it is with the Three Records on Earth, of <hi>Water, Blood, and Spirit:</hi> Theſe be Three diſtinct Records, And Three diſtinct Perſons; the head of theſe Three diſtinct Records. And there is Three diſtinct differances, in there viſible Worſhips; yet they all Three agree in one.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In witneſſing to that one Jeſus Chriſt to be the very true <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of all thoſe that believe in that the Word was God, And God was that Word, And the Word became Fleſh, and Dwelt among Men: He that is called the <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> the <hi>Firſt and the Laſt;</hi> The Begining and the End; He that was Dead and is Alive for Evermore.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. This one God, doth all the Three Records agree, to witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs unto this one God, though differing all of them in their Several diſpenſations, of outward Worſhip as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aid.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For every Record Acts his part upon this Earth, ſuitable to the Three Titles in Heaven; <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62853:55"/>
their parts in the diſpenſation of Water, as being under the Title of God the Father and Creatour of all things.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Chriſt and the Apoſtles, Acted their Commiſſion of the Blood, under the Title of a Redeemer by his own Blood, And he was that Word made Fleſh, And Dwelt among Men.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And now we the <hi>Witneſſes of the Spirit,</hi> do Act a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Record on Earth, which is to Worſhip God in <hi>Spirit, and Truth,</hi> Anſwerable to the Title of Spirit in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In Witneſſing to that one <hi>Perſonal God,</hi> though Three Titles, of Father, Word, and Spirit; yet but one Perſonal God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So that the Three Records on Earth, do agree in one, though they differ in their outward diſpenſations of worſhip as aforeſaid; ſo that we the Witneſſes do Act our part on Earth under the Title of the <hi>Holy Spirit in Heaven;</hi> therefore our Worſhip is Spiritual, and Inviſible in the Heart only.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And now you ſee, I have prov'd by Scripture; that the Commiſſion of the Spirit is now Extant upon the Earth; and Acted by Men like yourſelves, even by <hi>John Reeve, And myſelf;</hi> and thoſe that beleive our Doctrin.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Said I, do you beleive me now, I have prov'd by Scripture, that I am one of the Two laſt Prophets, and Witneſſes of the Spirit or laſt Record on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. He anſwered and ſaid, <hi>that he could not gain ſay any thing that I had ſpoken, but did aprove, of what I had ſaid better than of any that ever he heard in his life, but ſaid he could not venture his Salvation upon my Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Then ſaid the Sheriffs Men, and the Keeper of the Priſon, <hi>Now Mr.</hi> Benet, <hi>you have met with your Match, One that hath Anſwered you all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Benet, ſuffer me to ask you one queſtion more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. What is that ſaid I.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Why ſaith he; <hi>I have been a long time of the Oppinion,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62853:56"/>
that the Soul of Man is mortal and doth dye, But I cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie myſelf in it.</hi>

                  <p n="24">24. I anſwered and ſaid; your Oppinion was true, for the Soul of Man is Mortal and doth Dye, For nothing doth Live, but the Soul, for it is the Soul that Eats and Drinks, and Walks, and Talkes; And the Soul that Lives and Dyes, For nothing can be ſaid to Dye but Life, for if the Body be Dead, the Soul or Life is Dead alſo: For the Body and Soul is all one being: And if one be Alive, both are Alive, And if one be Dead, both are Dead.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For both Body and Soul, came into the World toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, For the Soul is begotten by Generation, as well as the Body; ſo that they go both Body and Soul, out of the World together; For that Life that is begot by Procuration muſt Dye, which all Souls are; and not by Infuſion from God, but by that very Law that ſaid Encreaſe and Multiply.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Therefore the Soul or Life of Man, and all things elſe, that is begotten by Generation muſt Dye as well as their Bodies.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>The Prophets Argument. And Examin'd by the Judge: And he Required of the Judge to take Bail, the Judge granted it: The Maior, Aldermen and Recorder that Committed him, ſaw their Folly and Madneſs, and were aſham'd of themſelves: How the Prophet had the Love of all the Priſoners. Of his Printing of the whole Book of the Revelation,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this diſpute aforeſaid, upon the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following being the laſt Day of the Aſſizes, I was call'd before the Bar: And when I came before the Bar.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Judge asked me, <hi>if I would be Try'd by this Note of Examination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I anſwered no, and ſaid, I thought your Honour would have excepted of Bail for my appearance the next Aſſizes; For Mrs. <hi>Carter</hi> had delivered the Judge a writing, to that purpoſe, of mine, the Day before; and the Judge, his Name was <hi>Terral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Judge, anſwered and ſaid; <hi>that he would take Bail,</hi> but had ſaid to her, he would ſee the Man: So when I asked him at the Bar to take Bail, the Judge ſaid, <hi>he would;</hi> and asked me who they were.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And I ſaid, one is <hi>Richard Sudbury;</hi> He asked <hi>where he Liv'd;</hi> I ſaid at <hi>Notingham;</hi> he asked <hi>what Trade;</hi> I ſaid an Iron-monger. Then <hi>Richard Sudbury</hi> was call'd, and the Judge asked him, <hi>whether he would be bound for my Appearence the next Aſſizes;</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he would;</hi> then the Judge Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be ſet down for one.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then ſaid the Judge; <hi>There muſt be another,</hi> then ſaid, I, there is one <hi>Edward Fewterer; where Liveth he,</hi> ſaid the Judge, I ſaid at <hi>Cheſterfield; what Trade,</hi> ſaid the Judge, I ſaid a Surgeion, then the Judge Commanded <hi>Edward Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer</hi> to be called, then the Judge asked him, <hi>whither he would
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62853:57"/>
be bound in two Hundred Pound Bond, for this Man's appearance,</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he would.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Then ſpeak one of the Aldermen of the Town; <hi>If it ſhall pleaſe your Honour;</hi> Mr. Fewterer <hi>is not Capable to be his Bail; why</hi> ſaid the Judge; ſaid he, <hi>Becauſe he is an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Perſon;</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>What was he Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for;</hi> ſaid he, <hi>For not coming to Church.</hi> Said the Judge, <hi>How long hath he been Excommunicated:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>but laſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; Puſh, ſaid the Judge, that Signifies nothing, Except it was for the cauſe of Adultry; ſet him down to be Bail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Then the Maior, Recorder, and Aldermen, all of them were Aſhamed and vexed, they could do me no further Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif, than Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And when I was Bail'd out of Priſon, the Maior and Conſtable, and the reſt were afraid I would trouble them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Maior for Committing me to Priſon, without any Accuſers, and denying to take Bail for me, and for not binding ſome over for to Proſecute againſt me, which things he did not, but was in danger to pay Five Pound a Day for falſe Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And the Conſtable, was like to ſuffer for Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, without a Warrant.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. I was Councelled to ſue them at the Law; and ſo I would, if they had put in any Indictment againſt me, but they were afraid; And did nothing but let it fall.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So I was quit, only it put me to a great deal of Charge, but ſeeing they put no Indictment againſt me, I let it paſs, and fall.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Dorothy Carter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sudbury,</hi> were great Friends in this buſineſs, both in Purſs and Perſon; becauſe I was taken at her Houſe, and ſhe brought me from <hi>Darby Goal,</hi> to her own Houſe again on Horſe back, which is 16 long Miles.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. I had the Love of all the Priſoners, on that ſide I was put; and they ſaid, <hi>they thought themſelves Bleſſed for myſake</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. For they were every one of them, that were with me, free'd without any puniſhment, only the Fees of the Priſon.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62853:57"/>
I was in Priſon in <hi>Darby Goal</hi> but nine Days, but this fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſo quickly after I was Married to my Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> it was ſome greif to her, but being delivered ſo quickly, ſhe was pacified the better.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. This was a Year of great Trouble to me, both upon a Spiritual Account, as afore Written; and upon a Temporal, which I ſhall not mention.</p>

                  <p n="20">20. Alſo, I wrote a Letter after that to <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> a Quaker, Containing two ſheets of Paper; And in the year 1665, I got them both Printed; they are yet to be ſeen by many.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this I travelled into <hi>Kent,</hi> to ſee my Wife's Friends, and there I had like to have been apprehended by the Judge of the Town, his Name was <hi>Twiſden:</hi> But I having intilligence of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Intent, I eſcaped away out of his Coaſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I wrote a Letter to him, forbiding him for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting any Man for his Conſcience: For tho' he was made a Judge of the Law in temporal Matters, yet he was not the Judge of Conſcience, nor of Spiritual Matters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore I adviſed him to meddle with thoſe Things he knows, as the Laws of the Land, and not with thoſe Things that belongs to God, as the Conſcience doth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For God only is the Judge of ſpiritual Things, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62853:58"/>
them whom he doth chuſe, leaſt you bring your ſelf under the Sentance of eternal Damnation: This Letter is large, but not in Print, but is yet to be ſeen in Writing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He was netled in his Mind at it, but knew not how to help himſelf; ſo he brought the Letter in his Hand to my Wife's Mother's Houſe, and asked her, if ſhe thought he ſhould be ever the worſe, if he did perſecute me; on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to inſnare her, becauſe ſhe did not go to Church, and was under his Power; for he was the crueleſt Devil to all Propheſſors of Religion, that did not conform to Worſhip as he did, that was in all that Country: Alſo he would have had a Book of her, that he might have done me the more Miſchief; but I charged her, before, to let him have none, nor none in that Town ſhould let him have one.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Alſo, I told him, in the Letter, that if he would ſend to me at <hi>London,</hi> and ſend Money, I would let him have half a Dozen of Books, ſeveral, but without Money he ſhould have none, for they coſt a great deal of Monies Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But he never ſent for any, but threatned my Mother, that if ever I came there any more to deceave People, as he called it, that he would do great Matters to me: So he went his way, and never came there more, as I hear'd of.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now by this time there was many Men and Women that did beleive in this Commiſſion of the Spirit; and the Doctrin of the true perſonal God was received by ſeveral Perſons of Quality, ſo that many were aded to the Faith: Some I ſhall name.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Firſt,</hi> One Mrs. <hi>Feild,</hi> who lived in <hi>Wales;</hi> ſhe was counted a Lady in that Country; and one Mrs. <hi>Sharte,</hi> a Draper's Wife in <hi>Cannon-ſtreet:</hi> This <hi>Sarah Sharte,</hi> ſhe ſent for me ſeveral times, to ſpeak with her, but the Meſſenger miſſed of me ſo oft, that ſhe thought herſelf forſaken of God, that ſhe could not ſpeak with me.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For ſhe had kept her Houſe ſeveral years of a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe had in her Body, ſo that ſhe could not go forth, nor come to me herſelf: So ſhe ſeeing none of them ſhe ſent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62853:59"/>
could meet with me, ſhe grew out of patience, and could not ſleep 'till ſhe had ſeen me.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So ſhe deſired her Husband, to go himſelf in the Morning betimes, before I was gon out; ſo he did, and he ingaged me to come to his Wife about Two of the Clock in the Afternoon, the ſame Day, for ſhe had a great Deſire to ſpeak with me.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. So at the time appointed I went, and ſhe was glad to ſee me, who had deſired it a long time: And when ſhe had ſeen me, and had diſcourſed with me about ſpiritual and heavenly Things, concerning God, his Form, and Nature: The right Devil, his Form and Nature: The Perſon and Nature of Angels: The Place and Nature of Hell: The Place and Nature of Heaven: The Rice of the Two Seeds, and of the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. And how every Man came to have two Voices; or Motions, ſpeaking in Man: Theſe were all heavenly Secrets, and hiden from the World, which I declared unto her, ſo that ſhe was very well ſatisfyed in her Mind; and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that I would come often to her, which I did always when ſhe ſent for me, not elſe: And ſhe was a true Beleiver afterwards, and lived in the full Aſſurance of her eternal Happineſs after Death, all the Days of her Life.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And ſhe had a Kinſwoman, a Virgin, that waited upon her, by reading of the Books her Aunt had of mine by ſtelth; ſhe became a true Beleiver, her Name was <hi>Ann Loe;</hi> and in proceſs of time this <hi>Ann Loe</hi> married one <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hall,</hi> a true Beleiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And ſhe did grow in Wiſdom and Knowledge, in ſpiritual and heavenly Knowledge and Experience, and ſtrong in Faith, more than her Aunt before her; and ſhe was a great preſerver of me, from the Hands of my Enemies, when the King's Meſſengers ſought after me; as will more appear hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of one Captain <hi>Wildye,</hi> an honourable Man: And of one Mrs. <hi>Cowlye,</hi> of her Faith, and Obedience of her Husband, and of her Son, a Univerſity Scholar; and of his Convinement by the Prophet, both as to the Miniſtry, Law, and Phiſick.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ALSO there was one Captain <hi>Wildye,</hi> he was one of the Maſters of <hi>Trinity-Houſe,</hi> an honourable Place: For that <hi>Trinity-Houſe</hi> is a Court for the ordering of Shiping, and Seamen: This Captain <hi>Wildye</hi> became a very true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit, and he ſhewed a great deal of Charity to ſeveral poor Beleivers of this Faith, more than any perticular Perſon in his time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Alſo he was the occaſion of bringing to this Faith one <hi>Ann Cowlye,</hi> a Gentlewoman at <hi>Mile-End-Green.</hi> She was carried through ſeveral Principles of Religion, as <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Quaker,</hi> and <hi>Virgin-Life-People:</hi> She was zealous in all things ſhe clave unto, being very deſirous to be ſaved, and afraid to be damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. She was in the Principle of a <hi>Virgin-Life,</hi> and would not let her Husband know her in Twelve years before ſhe ſaw me, notwithſtanding ſhe had born ſeveral Children by this Man, and had one Son and one Daughter living by him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But after ſhe came to be acquainted with me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her both by Scripture and Reaſon, of the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a married Wife, to live a <hi>Virgin-Life,</hi> and that ſhe could not poſſibly have Peace as to another Life in that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: And I adviſed her to give herſelf up to her Husband, elſe I could not give Judgment of Bleſſedneſs upon her to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. She being troubled at this ſaying of mine, was forced
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62853:60"/>
to yield to her Husband, which thing, ſhe thought an Angel from Heaven could not have perſwaded her to do.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the Words of a Prophet was of great Power, whoſe Word ſhe could not reſit, but obeyed his Voice, and had Peace of Minde, and the Bleſſing of eternal Life in her Self; and ſhe grew very zealous for the Commiſſion of the Spirit, and contended for the Faith very much; and this thing wrought upon her by the Word of a Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This cauſed her Husband to beleive alſo; and he was a very Wife and Prudent Man of the <hi>Independant</hi> People, who had been a Preacher among them; he became a very knowing Man in the Faith, alſo his Son and his Daughter became both true Beleivers of this Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. His Son, <hi>John Cowlye</hi> was well bread, he was brought up at the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his Learning coſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many hundred Pounds, and when he was to receave ſome Benefit or Livelyhood for the future, for all the coſt paſt; the Benefice was, to be ordain'd a Miniſter, or a Doctor of Phiſick, or a Lawyer: Theſe Three be the moſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Things in this World.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But when he came to ſpeak with me I convinced him of the Unlawfullneſs of all the Three, for any Saint, or Gods Elect to undertake that Practice.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Seed of the Serpent were the fiteſt Men to take them Practices upon them, becauſe all the Kingdoms of this World is given into the Hands of the Seed of the Serpent, as the Devil ſaid to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And theſe Three ſorts of Men are reputed by the Seed of the Serpent, the moſt honourable Men of all, and are reverenced and ſubjected unto, both by Princes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, yet the greateſt Cheats that is in this World, as will appear.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Firſt, I ſhewed him how dangerous a thing it was to take upon him to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, it would be counted by him ſpiritual High Treaſon: For Miniſters are in more Danger of eternal
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62853:60"/>
Damnation than any other Men, for going to Preach, and are not ſent of God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For when they ſhall ſay in the Conſcience at that Day, <hi>Lord, we have preached in thy Name, and prayed in thy Name, and caſt out Devils in thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Anſwer of God in the Conſcience, will ſay, <hi>Depart from me you workers of Iniquity, I know you not:</hi> And why did not God know them, becauſe he did not ſend them. So that preaching and praying as a Miniſter, without a Commiſſion from Chriſt, is counted but a Work of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And as for the Doctors of Phiſick, they are the greateſt Cheats, upon a natural Account, that is in the World: They cheat the People of their Money, and of their Health; for they are in the original, but atheiſtical Witches; and it would be good if there were never a Doctor of Phiſick in the World, People would live longer, and live better in Health.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. For God never appointed any Doctor of Phiſick, but he appointed Nature to preſerve Nature.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But through the wicked intemperate Life of Man it hath brought a neceſſity of Doctors of Phiſick.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But thoſe People that go to a Doctor of Phiſick to get Health, he goeth to a Witch to ſeek his Health, even as a Man that is troubled in Mind ſeeketh unto a Witch that hath a Familier Spirit for ſatisfaction, as did King Saul.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But when the Conſcience of the Doctor of Phiſick ſhall be opened at the laſt Day, he ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, we did not think that there were any God at all, but Nature only; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Minds fed upon Gold and Silver that groweth in the Earth, that we might Cloath our ſelves in rich Apparel, that might make us honourable among great Men of the Earth, and reverenced by the Poor; not thinking, in the leaſt, that there was any better Heaven hereafter, or any Puniſhment after Death for practiſeing this Cheat, that is Autheriſed by the Powers of the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>And tho' we have done a great deal of Hurt, yet, Lord, we have done ſome good; we have caſt out many Devils in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62853:61"/>
and Whoremaſters, and Whores, who by their Wickedneſs have procured that Pox which no righteous Man could cure; we have made them leave off that Practice by our Medicines and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and from Drunkenneſs, and have lived a ſober Life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and many diviliſh Diſeaſes have we caſt out by our Spirits of Witchcraft, which we have given them to drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. But the Anſwer in the Conſcience will ſay, <hi>Inaſmuch as you fhrſake me, the living God and creator of all things, and ſaid, in your Hearts, There is no God, then you gave your ſelves up to natural Witchcraft, diving into the nature of the Planits and Stars, and into the Spirit of the Herbs of the Field, ſo that you became abſolute Witches your ſelves, and you have cauſed Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Men and Women to be bewitched by you, both in their Bodies, Souls and Eſtates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Therefore depart from me you atheiſtical workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into utter Darkneſs, where is weeping and knaſhing of Teeth for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. And as for the Lawyers, they keep the Keys of the Knowledge of the Law, and will neither enter into Truth and Honeſty themſelves, nor ſuffer others to enter in that would.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. For no Man can do anything in his own Cauſe, but as his Lawyer inſtructs him; for he is ſworn when he enters into that Practice, he hath a Commiſſion to keep the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law from his Clyant, ſo that the Clyant being ignorant how to proceed in Law, Step by Step, the innocent Clyant his Clauſe is many times put off and neglected by his Lawyer, to the great Diſcontent and further Charge of the innocent and juſt Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And as for the Poor, that can have no Law at all, tho his Cauſe be ever ſo juſt, no Judge will hear him, nor no Lawyer will give him any Councel, except he hath Monies in his Hand; nor no Judge will do the Poor any Juſtice, except he go in the way of the Law, and that the Poor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So that if the Birthright of the Poor be ever ſo great, or juſt, it muſt be loſt, for want of Monies to fee Lawyers:

Beſides, where Monies is to be had, let a Man's Cauſe be never ſo unjuſt, yet Lawyers will undertake it, though they know certainly that their Clyant will be overthrown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took it in hand: This is Wickedneſs in a high degree, ſo contrary to the Law writen in Man's Heart. <hi>To do as he would be done unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. But the Government of this World hath brought a neceſſity of the uſe of Lawyers; but it is not expedient that any Saint ſhould take that Practice upon them, there is enough of them in the World, it being the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But when the Book of Conſcience, the Law writen in the Lawyer's Heart, is opened, at the laſt Day, what can they plead for themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. They will ſay, <hi>Lord, we thought, becauſe it was the Government of the Nation, and that learning of the Knowledge of the Law it made us rich and honourable among Men; it made us Companions for the wiſe and great Men of the World; the Knowledge of the Law, it made us Atornies, Councellors and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jants at Law; honourable Places, and by degrees we came to be Judges of the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>So that Kings and Princes have asked Councel at our Lips, we have Cloathed our ſelves with fine Scarlet and white Robes, ſignifying Juſtice and Mercy to the People: We have been as Gods upon the Earth, and we have done juſtice to ſome in all our Degrees, tho we have failed in others, therefore hope for Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. But the Anſwer in the Conſcience will ſay, <hi>In as much as you have fed upon Riches and Honour all your Days, and have not walked by the Law written in your Hearts, To do as you would have been done unto, had you been in their Condition, and they in yours; but you have the Penny of this World, Riches and Honour, your Hearts Delight: Therefore depart you wicked Lawyers, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Iniquity, into utter Darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth for ever more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. This I know will come to paſs in theſe Three ſorts of Men, in that Day when God ſhall raiſe the Dead.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. When the young Man heard theſe Things, he left all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62853:62"/>
Preferment that way, for Truths ſake, and became a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and true Beleiver, and he being a Scholar was mighty able to oppoſe the Learned.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Alſo there was one <hi>Robert Phare,</hi> he was Governor of the City of <hi>Corke</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was inclineable to be a <hi>Quaker;</hi> but after he ſaw me, and had read our Writings, he became a true Beleiver of this Commiſſion of the Spirit, and ſo did the Lady his Wife: She became the chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion in this Faith of all the Women in that Nation.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Alſo he had Four Sons and Daughters that were true Beleivers: He was the cauſe of many Perſons of Value in that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that did truly Beleive, as one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Moſs</hi> and his Wife, and Doctor <hi>Moſs,</hi> his Son; and Captain <hi>Gaill,</hi> and Major <hi>Denſon,</hi> and <hi>George Gamble,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Merchant. And ſeveral more, which I omit to name, becauſe it would be too tedious, that were true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers in that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. After this it came to paſs that I wrote a Book in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>George Fox,</hi> Quaker; containing Twelve ſheets and a half of Paper, and got it Printed in the Year 1668. and in the Seventeenth year of my Commiſſion, and in the year of my Life 58.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. This Book cauſed the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be exceedingly angry at me, and ſeveral Speakers of them to write curſed Letters unto me, and ſome of them came to diſcourſe with me, and a woful Ephect did befal ſome of them a little while after, as is expreſſed in the Writing following.</p>

WHO ever may read this Letter, let them underſtand thus much, that I never ſaw the Man, nor he me; but he reading the Book aforeſaid, he was moved by the Light within him to ſend this curſed Letter unto me: Whereupon, after I had read it, I ſent him an Anſwer to it, with the Sentance of eternale Damnation for his curſed Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.

to the Grave, which was almoſt Three Weeks after. Which is a clear Teſtimony that the Curſe of God, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, by his Meſſenger doth take hold of the Quakers People, and more eſpecially of their Miniſtry.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe they are the abſolute Spirit of Antichriſt in this laſt Age, which teacheth the People to deny both Father and Son to become Fleſh, and that the Father, nor the Son hath no Perſon of his own diſtinct from Man, but denyeth a perſonal God in form like Man, his own Image.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Upon the Sickneſs and Death of this <hi>Thomas Loe,</hi> Quaker, after the Sentance ſent him, it cauſed ſeveral to diſcourſe with me about it, therefore I ſhall relate ſome of the moſt remarkable Paſſages, and the Perſons I diſcourſed with upon the 17th. Day of <hi>October</hi> 1668. The Perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed withal were <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Joſiah Cole,</hi> both Speakers of the Quakers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Eirſt, The Words <hi>Cole</hi> ſpoke unto me are theſe (ſaith he) <hi>Thou ſayeſt God is in form of a Man, and thou ſayeſt his Hand is not much biger than thine or mine, and thou ſeeſt what a little this Hand will hold: Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God is ſaid to have meaſured the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and behold the Nations are as a drop of a Bucket.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>Do you beleive God to be ſo big to hold the Waters in the hollow of his Hand?</hi> That is ſpoken in Relation to his great Wiſdom, Power, and Dominion, as he is a Creator, not relating to the bigneſs of his Hand, but to the greatneſs of his Power, being infinite.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62853:63"/>8. An earthly King may be ſaid to be King of many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and that he hath brought the People of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to Obedience to his Law: By the ſtrength of his own Arm, for Power, or Strength is the right Hand of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Yet the King doth not hold all the People under his Arm, nor in the hollow of his Hand, but the People may be ſaid to be under his Hand, and that he holds them in the hollow of his Hand, becauſe his Power and Laws doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, and keep them within Bounds, for a prerogative Power is great, but the Hand of a King is no biger than the Hand of another Man, that hath no Power at all.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So it is Gods prerogative Power that is above all Law, in ſeting Bounds to the Waters, and keeping the Waters within Bounds in the deep Places of the Earth; and ſo may be ſaid, that God doth hold the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, that is, they are confined to a little place of his Power in his Creation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Alſo I ſaid, that I that am but a mortal Man hath Power over ſuch a great God whoſe Hand is ſo big; for that God, whoſe Hand is much biger than thine or mine, I have Power to Condemn. This was paſſed by, and no Reply made by them.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Then ſpake <hi>Whitehead,</hi> and ſaid, He did hear that I had curſed a Man, and he changing his Aparel, came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and did procure a Bleſſing, and that this Man, or ſome other, did ſmite a Pewter Pot upon my Head.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. This, I ſaid, was falſe, for never did any Man ſtrike me over the Head with a Pot, in all <hi>my Life;</hi> it was that reprobate <hi>Pope,</hi> that damd'd Devil, <hi>that hath</hi> reported that he was Bleſſed after he was Curſed: It is a falſe Report, and he hath reported it ſeveral times amongſt the Ranters and Quakers,</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This <hi>Pope</hi> was a Ranter then, when he was Curſed, which was about fifteen Years ago, in <hi>John Reeve's</hi> time, and he is a worſe Ranter now than he was then, and that you Quakers know very well, and what a wicked luſtful
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62853:64"/>
Life he liveth now in, and yet you will rather beleive the damn'd Devil, and wicked luſtful Perſon than beleive me, who have been kept innocent from the breach of any Law, from my Childhood to this Day.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But I know, you Quakers, being of the ſame Nature and Seed of the Serpent, as thoſe Jews were in Chriſt's time, who deſired of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that a Thief and a Murtherer ſhould be delivered from Death rather than Jeſus, the Saviour of all them that beleive in him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So is it with you for you had rather beleive this <hi>Pope,</hi> this notable Sinner, than to beleive me, who am the Prophet of the moſt High God, the Man Chriſt Jeſus in Glory, and have Power given of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, to ſet Life and Death before you; but I know you do ſay in your Hearts, tho not with your Lips, as thoſe Jews did by Chriſt, <hi>Away with this</hi> Muggleton, <hi>let us have</hi> Pope, <hi>that wicked luſtful Man, that we might hear and inquire of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Then ſaid <hi>Joſiah Cole, Thou ſaiſt thou art an Embaſſador in God's ſteed, and thou ſtandeſt in his ſtead;</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I would willingly do anything that I might be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Then I anſwered him, and ſaid, <hi>I will tell thee what I will ſay unto thee, if thou wilt but deny, and forſake the Quakers Principles, and beleive me, I will aſſure thee thou ſhalt as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved as ever any Prophet or Apoſtle ever was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Then <hi>Cole</hi> fell into a Fit, and waited upon his own Thoughts, what to anſwer, and I waited for his Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> perceived that <hi>Cole</hi> was in a ſtrait, he came unto me, and ſpied a Knot of Ribon upon my Coat Sleeve, and ſaid unto me, <hi>VVhy doſt thou wear this Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and touched the Ribon with his Fingers.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. I anſwered and ſaid, <hi>I know a piece of Ribon is a great Sin in a Quaker's Eye;</hi> But, ſaid I, <hi>VVhy doſt thou wear ſilk Buttons on both thy Coats?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>they were neceſſary.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>No, thou mighteſt wear Hooks and Eyes, Clapſes or Eyletholes:</hi> That was paſt by.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>But then I will tell thee why I do wear Ribon, it is on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62853:64"/>
that I might not be taken, or thought to be a Quaker, for I do hate the Quakers Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. With that <hi>VVhitehead</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou hateſt all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and ſpake as if he himſelf, <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Fox,</hi> and others of the Quakers were writing a Book againſt me, to make me manifeſt, which in a little time after it was ſet forth by <hi>VVilliam Pen,</hi> a Quaker: And further ſaid, <hi>that they would poſt me up,</hi> and he ſlighted my Power and my God, and ſaid, <hi>he would trample my God and my Power under his Feet as Dirt,</hi> and taped his Foot upon the Ground.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Whereupon I did pronounce <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> curſed and damn'd Soul and Body, to Eternity, and that God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, which he truſted in, was curſed alſo; and ſo I ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcourſe with him.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. All this while <hi>Cole</hi> was in his Fit, and ſaid not one word, but immediately after he uttered theſe words; ſaith he, <hi>I have heard of ſeveral thou haſt curſed;</hi> but ſaid he, <hi>I did not beleive, had I not heard or ſeen, I could not have beleived that a Man could have ſpoken ſo preſumptiouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Then ſaid I, <hi>dare you ſay that I ſpeak preſumptiouſly,</hi> to <hi>George VVhitehead;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he did beleive it was Preſumption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Then ſaid I, on the contrary, <hi>I do beleive that thou art the Seed of the Serpent and wilt be damn'd; and now ſee whoſe Faith will be ſtrongeſt, yours or mine; for my Faith ſhall keep you down for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. <hi>Under what?</hi> ſaid <hi>Cole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. <hi>Under eternal Damnation,</hi> ſaid I.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Then ſaid he, <hi>Doſt thou ground thy Sentance upon my Belief?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I do,</hi> for you beleive I ſpeak preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiouſly, and I do beleive you to be the Seed of the Serpent, and will be damn'd to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Then ſaid he, <hi>Doſt thou judge this to be a final Sentance upon me?</hi> ſaid I, <hi>Yea, what ſhould it elſe be?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. With that <hi>Joſiah Cole</hi> roſe up with great zeal for his God within him, and ſaid, <hi>I told thee before that I would try thee and thy God,</hi> ſaying that they were ſeting forth a Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt me, and withal <hi>Cole</hi> pronounced many Curſes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62853:65"/>
upon me, with his Eyes dazled with the Witchcraft Power in him, being diſturbed with my Words, it got up into his Head.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. So that <hi>VVhitehead</hi> and he both came near me with great Threatnings and Judgments upon me, being both ſo full of Curſes: <hi>Cole</hi> curſed me into utter Darkneſs, Pit of Darkneſs, Chains of Darkneſs, blackneſs of Darkneſs; and that he would trample that God of mine, that was in the form of Man, under his Feet, as Dirt, and ſtamp'd his Foot upon the Ground, as the other Devil did: <hi>Cole's</hi> Curſes were much what like <hi>Thomas Loe,</hi> his Curſes in his Letter to me.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. But when <hi>Cole</hi> had done curſing, I ſaid theſe Words unto him, <hi>That this Sentance that I had paſſed upon him ſhould ſtick by him for ever, and that he ſhould never put it out of his Mind, neither ſhould he grow Mad nor Diſtracted to forget it, but ſhould be ſenſible all the Days of his Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. <hi>And when my God, whom you trampled under your Feet, ſhall raiſe you again at the laſt Day, which will not ſeem to you a quarter of an Hours time, you ſhall remember afreſh my VVords, what I ſaid unto you in this Life to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="37">37. Many more Words was between us at that time, but theſe were the Words and Paſſages of moſt concernment at that time, and a final Judgment and Sentance of eternal Damnation that I gave that Day upon <hi>Joſiha Cole,</hi> and <hi>George VVhitehead,</hi> Speakers of the Quakers.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP.

Of <hi>William Pen's</hi> blaſphemous Letter to the Prophet.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW in ſome Four or Five Days time after our Diſpute, I heard that <hi>Joſiah Cole</hi> was ſick, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Body: For the Quakers do not beleive that their Souls do die, but ſlips out of the Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This cauſed the Quakers People to viſit him very much, to know of him, whether <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s Words had taken place in him, wondering that he ſhould go out of the Body ſo ſudenly after <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s Sentance, as <hi>Thomas Loe</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sentance. But he denyed very ſtifly that my Words had no Power over him, but that he had left me in Chains of Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nevertheleſs he grew worſe and worſe, ſo that the Quakers were not ſatisfied except he would go to the <hi>Peal</hi> in St. <hi>John's Street</hi> at their Meeting-place, and give his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt <hi>Muggleton</hi> before the People, to ſatisfy the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Quakers, elſe they would judge that his Power in <hi>Loe</hi> and him was greater than the Miniſtry of the Quakers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So they led him by the Arms to the place aforeſaid, and <hi>Joſiah Cole</hi> wrote his Teſtimony, as followeth, exactly word for word.

                  <p n="5">5. This was given forth word for word by <hi>Joſiah Cole,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Three Hours before his departure out of the Body, the Fifteenth of the Eleventh Month 68.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whoever doth read this laſt Teſtimony of <hi>Joſiah Cole,</hi> may eaſily ſee that the Curſe I pronounced upon him by Commiſſion, received from the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the only wiſe God, bleſſed for ever, in the form of a Man, whom he diſpiſed and trampled under his Feet as Dirt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For this very Sin, did this Curſe of this God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by me take Ephect upon him and <hi>Thomas Loe,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their curſed Blaſphemy againſt the true God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I was zealous in giving Sentance upon them, in that I heard the true God was trampled under their Foot as Dirt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As for their Reproaches, Lyes, Slanders, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned againſt me, I did not matter: For this I know the Quakers do beleive, that <hi>Loe</hi> and <hi>Cole's</hi> Souls is not dead, but ſlipt out of their Bodies, and gon you know not where, and into a Power you know not what.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But I ſaid their Souls is where you laid their Bodies, they both came into this World together, they both diſpiſed the Truth together, they, both Bodies and Souls received
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62853:66"/>
Judgment and Condemnation together, and both dyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and were both Soul, and Bodies buried together, and ſhall both riſe again ſpiritual dark Bodies and Souls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Every Seed its own Body; that Seed of Reaſon which was their Life, which they thought was the divine Nature of God, but it was the Nature of the Devil and Serpent.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And the Law writen in their Hearts, which you Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers call the Light of Chriſt, or Chriſt in you; which is no other Chriſt or Light but the Law writen in your Hearts. And the Light of the Law, which doth accuſe and excuſe the Conſcience of every Man, you call the Light of Chriſt, yea Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For this Light of the Law writen in your Hearts, is that which doth cauſe your Thoughts to accuſe when you do evil, and to excuſe when you do well: And when God ſhall raiſe them again, that Seed of Reaſon ſhall riſe and bring a ſpiritual dark Body with it: And that Law which was writen in their Hearts here in this Life, ſhall quicken again in that new dark ſpiritual Body.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And then ſhall they and you, diſpiſers of a perſonal God, know that your own Souls, which you thought was the Life of God, but it was the Life of the Devil, and that your ſelves were Devils, and that Law writen in your Hearts, which you in this Life called the Light of Chriſt, and that was no other God or Chriſt but this Light within you.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But when this Law doth quicken again, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it will prove the only and alone Devil to torment you to eternity; becauſe you made the Light of this Law in your Hearts to be your only God; and by this Light of the Law you do fight againſt the true perſonal God, who created Man in his own Image and Likeneſs, and hath trampled him under your Feet as Dirt.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Theſe things may ſeem ſtrange, and as a Riddle unto you, and as a thing impoſſible, but with God all things is poſſible, which his own Will moves him unto.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And this I ſay, as it was poſſible for God to write the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62853:67"/>
Law in the Angels Natures, and by his ſecret Determination ſuffer one of theſe Angels to become very Man, and ſo the Angels Seed and Nature having conjunction with the Seed and Nature of <hi>Eve,</hi> which was of <hi>Adams</hi> Nature, and ſo by Generation the Law comes to be writen in every Man's Heart; in that ever Man and Woman that is born into this World is partaker of the Angel's Nature of Reaſon, and ſo comes to have this Law writen in every Man's Heart.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Man finds it there accuſing of him, but knows not how it came writen there.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So it is as ſtrange for you Quakers to beleive, that God will raiſe your Souls again that were dead, how they ſhould quicken out of Death, by the Power of that God that made all Souls to live at the firſt: In as much as he made all things by the power of his word in the Beginning.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. So by the ſame power of his word he ſhall quicken the Souls of Men and Women again, out of Death to Life again at the laſt day; and the Law that was writen in them ſhall quicken alſo, and be alive again in you, to torment you to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For the Law and your Souls ſhall never part one from the other; for as the Law is ſecretly writen in your Hearts, but originally in the Reprobate: So by Gods ſecret Decree, and Power he will revive that Law again in that Reprobate Seed of Reaſon, as in <hi>Thomas Loe, Joſiah Cole, George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, William Pen,</hi> and many of you Speakers of the Quakers, and others of your Bretheren, who are under the Judgment and Sentance of this Commiſſion of the Spirit: You ſhall find my words to be true upon you, and over you, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; neither ſhall you be delivered from it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For if I had but any thought of Compaſſion towards you in my Mind, it was anſwered me, That there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that there ſhould be Enmity between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent, which hardened
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62853:67"/>
my Heart againſt all Diſpiſers of a perſonal God in the form of Man.</p>

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1. WIlliam Pen,</hi> I have peruſed your proud, preſumptious, blaſphemous Letter againſt the true God; how hath your Learning lifted up your Heart with Pride, to fight againſt the true God, and to bid him Defiance to his Face, and let him ſtand forth and ſee, if he can deliver himſelf from your bodileſs God, that gave you a Commiſſion, as you ſay.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> You know that <hi>Reeve</hi> and myſelf have declared in all our Writings, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our God, and that the Worlds were made by him, and that nothing was made in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but what was made by him, as the Scripture ſaith.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> This Man Chriſt Jeſus was in the form of Man, a ſpiritual, heavenly and glorious Body, before this World was.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> And in the Beginning this glorious, ſpiritual Body made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs, the Form of Man, elſe <hi>Moſes's</hi> Words were not true; do you diſprove it if you can.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Only the Man <hi>Adam,</hi> his Body was earthly, and made of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62853:68"/>
the Earth, but God's Body was ſpiritual and heavenly, yet in Form like <hi>Adam:</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> was a Man, which none can deny that owns the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> And in proceſs of time this God became Fleſh, and dwelt among Men, and that he took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was in all things like unto Man, Sin excepted, and made himſelf capable to be put to Death, by the Seed of the Serpent, his own Creatures; his Blood was poured out unto Death, for the Redemption of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> to make good that Promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head:</hi> Which was fulfilled when he ſuffered Death upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> And when he quickened out of Death into Life again, then was that Saying fulfilled, <hi>Oh Death, I will be thy Death, Oh Grave, I will be thy Victory:</hi> And that other Saying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the Firſt and the Laſt, he that was dead, and behold I am alive for ever more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> This <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> was Chriſt, and he was God; and this Chriſt was the Lord from Heaven, a quickening Spirit: And was there any other God, or <hi>Alpha</hi> or <hi>Omega</hi> that dyed but Chriſt, and did any quicken out of Death to Life again but he; and did any God become Fleſh and dwell with Man but Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> And was not Chriſt in the form of Man, when on Earth; did not he retain the ſame form when he aſſended up to Heaven, and doth retain the ſame Form now he is glorified; and is in the ſame Glory which he had before this World was.</p>
                  <p n="10">

                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> Did you never read of <hi>Corath</hi> and his Company, Captains of Rebellion and Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God that choſe them to teach the People; neither would God ſuffer any other Men to do it but them he choſe; therefore it was the Earth clave and ſwallowed them all up alive.</p>

And there was one <hi>James Whitehead</hi> who lived in <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a true Beleiver, and a Man of an Eſtate in this World; he was of the Independant People before he came to beleive in this Commiſſion of the Spirit, he had a deſire to viſit Friends of this Faith in other Countries, becauſe he had never ſeen them, ſo he was willing to bear me company.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I went this Jorny in ſecret, and let no Beleiver in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> know of it, but my Wife only.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I appointed <hi>James Whitehead</hi> to meet me at <hi>Ware,</hi> and ſo he did, and we went from thence to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and we ſtayed there three Days with Friends at <hi>William Dickmſon's</hi> Houſe, for I had many Friends in that Town and Country about, and they were very glad to ſee us, and intreated us kindly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So we departed after three Days from thence to <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> which was forty Miles from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in two days we came to ſome Friends in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> where were ſeveral Beleivers which I had never ſeen before.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And we lodged at one <hi>John Hall's</hi> Houſe, a Farmer, where was kind Entertainment, both for our ſelves and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62853:70"/>
Horſes; and the Mother of this <hi>John Hall</hi> was a true Beleiver and ſhe had three Sons that were true Beleivers of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Spirit; but they knew nothing of my Jorny beforehand.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But they intreated us exceeding kindly, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rejoyced to ſee us, becauſe they had never ſeen us before, though much deſired; and coming upon them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, they having no Inteligence, it did amuſe them the more.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Alſo there was one <hi>John Sadington,</hi> a true Beleiver, had a Siſter hard by there, named <hi>Lidiah Brooks,</hi> that did truly beleive, and ſhe rejoyced to ſee me, becauſe ſhe never ſaw me before, nor none of them there, tho they had heard of me, by the hearing of the Ear, the Towns name was <hi>Arnsby</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſtayed there but two Days and departed, and jorny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Notingham,</hi> there we came unawares to Mr. <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s and his Wife, and <hi>Mary Parker,</hi> a Sheriff's Wife of that Town: There were but thoſe three Beleivers in that Town, and they kindly received us with much affection.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And <hi>James Whitehead</hi> departed from thence in two Days, and left me there, for to meet him at <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> in <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> which was twenty Miles from <hi>Notingham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to go forty Miles further about other buſineſs, and was to call at <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> as he came back.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Likewiſe he was to ſee if he could enquire in his Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for one <hi>Thomas Tomkinſon,</hi> a true Beleiver, and a great Writer in the vindication of this Faith; he lived at <hi>Slade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. He did in his Jorny enquire for <hi>Sladehouſe,</hi> and the Name of our Friend, but could not hear, neither of the place, nor of the Man, nor could not hear that any knew <hi>Slade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> or <hi>Thomas Tomkinſon,</hi> he not travelling within twelve Miles of the place.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So he miſſed of him, which was a greet Trouble to us all when he came back to <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> and told it to us, we were much troubled.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:62853:71"/>14. For I did fully expect he had found him, becauſe he ſtayed two Days longer than was intended.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But it was an exceeding great Trouble to him that he ſhould miſs of the Sight of us, being ſo near; and many more in that Country had an earneſt Deſire to ſee me, for I had not then ever been in that Country.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And when it was too late, he did hear by one <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Delamaine,</hi> a true Friend at <hi>London,</hi> and a great writer in vindication of this Commiſſion of the Spirit, for as ſoon as ever he heard that I had ſtolen away out of <hi>London</hi> into the Country, and none in <hi>London</hi> knew of it; for it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Week afterwards before he heard I was gone, for he heard from ſome in the Country where we had been.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So he ſent <hi>Thomas Tomkinſon</hi> word by the Poſt, that I and my Friend were ſome where in thoſe parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: ſo <hi>Tomkinſon</hi> went immediately to <hi>Bakewell,</hi> a Market Town, where one of our Friends ſaw me at <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> his Name was <hi>William Newcome,</hi> a Bookſeller, who lived at <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> but was every <hi>Saturday</hi> at <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> Market, and at <hi>Bakewell</hi> Market on the <hi>Monday.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. And he told our Friend <hi>Tomkinſon,</hi> that I and my Friend Mr. <hi>Whitehead</hi> departed from <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> that <hi>Monday</hi> morning, and that he ſaw us take leave of Mrs. <hi>Carter</hi> and her Daughter, as alſo <hi>Elizabeth Smith,</hi> and other Friends at <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> for to go by <hi>Notingham,</hi> and from thence, on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> they ſaid they would go for <hi>London,</hi> the ſame way they came, and call of the ſame Friends.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And when our Friend <hi>Tomkinſon</hi> heard this; and that it was too late to meet with us, neither at <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> nor <hi>Notingham</hi> neither, he was exceedingly troubled, and lift up his Voice and wept, and could not tell who to be angry with, himſelf, or with us.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. So that he could not be paſſified in his own Mind, 'till Patience had poſſeſt his Soul, until he heard from me the Cauſe of that Misfortune.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For I depended wholy that Mr. <hi>Whitehead</hi> would have found him out; but it was ſuch a croſs Rode that no Letter
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62853:71"/>
could be ſent unto him but from <hi>London,</hi> except it were on purpoſe, ſo that I made no queſtion but my Friend would have brought him along with him to <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but could not hear of the Place nor of the Man.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So all Intents were fruſtrated, which cauſed trouble of Mind to us all, for no People have greater Love to one another than thoſe of this Faith.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. We were in this jorny, going and coming, and at Friends Houſes about five Weeks.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFTER this, in the ſame year 1669. I wrote two Books, the one of them was an Anſwer to <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                     <hi>Penington,</hi> a Quaker, who wrote a Book againſt me: And the other Book was the Interpretation of the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> and other Witches; and in the Winter I did endeavor to get them printed, and had agreed with two ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it came to paſs that the Anſwer to <hi>Penington</hi> was taken in the Preſs, through ſome Neglect of the Printer, when half a Sheet had been printed; but the Searcher of the Preſs, he being a violent Man, he made a great adoe about it, and troubled the Printer, and put him to the Charge of Seven Pounds, and me Five Pounds, to pacify the matter; But the Interpretation of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> eſcaped in the other Printer's Hands, and is now in Print, and giveth great Satisfaction to many in that Point.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After this, it came to paſs, in the year 1670. before
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62853:72"/>
                     <hi>Midſumer,</hi> there came Fourteen Men to ſearch my Houſe, for unlicenſed Books; theſe Men were informed by the Printer, but they would not connfeſs who ſent them: There was Three or Four of the King's Meſſengers, and the Warden of the Stationer's Company, and Printers and Bookſellers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Warden was very ſurly, when my Wife asked what he would have: He bid her open the Door, elſe he would break it open: She ſaid, She would not, unleſs he would tell his Buſineſs: So he made no more adoe, pulled the Hatch, and wrenched open the Spring-Lock, and came runing up Stairs ſo ſudainly that no Door in the Houſe could be locked.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And being ſo many of them, they ran into every Room in the Houſe, and they came into the uper Rooms where I was, and there they ſeized upon Ten Poundſworth of Books, and were binding them up to carry away.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſaid, <hi>I hope you are civil Gentlemen, there is nothing in the Books that is againſt King or State, and ſome of them were printed before the King came into</hi> England; <hi>and if you will be pleaſed to ask what Mony you will for your Pains and Civility, I will give it you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Then ſaid one of them, <hi>Do you think we will be bribed?</hi> Then ſaid I, <hi>Who is the chief among you, that I may appeal to him for Relief when you have taken them away.</hi> Said they, <hi>here is Mr.</hi> White, <hi>the Warden of the</hi> Stationers Company, <hi>he hath the Warrant, and is chief, and he liveth in St.</hi> John's <hi>on</hi> Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inwell-Green: Then ſaid I, <hi>take them away,</hi> and I helped them to Strings to ty them faſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And when they ſaw this, that I was ſo fair, and gave them goodly Words, not in the leaſt charging them with Folly or Unrighteouſneſs, they went from me into another Room, and whiſpered among themſelves, and ſaid one to another, <hi>Theſe Books are moſt of them againſt the Quakers, and ſome Printed long ago, we had beſt only take one a piece ſingle, and one bound alltogether, and leave the reſt till we have read them over, to ſee what is in them:</hi> So they agreed thus among themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:62853:72"/>9. Then Mr. <hi>White,</hi> the Warden came to me, and ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Muggleton, <hi>you ſhall ſee that we will be civil; we will only take one of theſe bound alltogether, and of each ſingle; and let the reſt be forthcoming when we ſhall call for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. I thanked him for his Civility: So they departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at that time, only one of them, took one of the Books bound altogether under his Coate, more than was agreed by themſelves, and it was well I eſcaped ſo: And about Four or Five Days after I ſent a Letter to Mr. <hi>White</hi> the Warden, praiſing him, and the Gentlemen with him, for their Kindneſs and Civility; and withal I ſent him Two Guinea Pieces of Gold by my Wife, to drink with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and prayed him to accept of them, and if I were a Man of Ability I would have given a great deal more.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For civil Kindneſs ought to be reſpected, for I know you had Power to have taken them away; and that if you would be pleaſed to ſend but one of thoſe Books bound, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by my Wife, that I might know by that you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of that ſmall Token of my Love for your civil Uſage.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Letter was more large, but Mr. <hi>White</hi> read the Letter twice, and ſaid to my Wife. <hi>Indeed one of the Men did take a Book under his Coat,</hi> but ſaid, <hi>he ſhall reſtore it again, for it is your Husband's; and as for the Two Guinea's,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let them alone 'till you hear further from me, for it doth not ly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in my Power to accept of them;</hi> So he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Two Guineas.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So my Wife brought them again, and I waited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to hear from him, but did not; for I perceived he had turned the Power over to the King's Meſſengers, as I found afterwards; for I heard, by one that belongs to the Law, that ſaw my Name in a Warrant in the Office, to take my Perſon, and to bring me before the Councel of State, ſo he gave me Intilligence of it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So I went from my own Houſe, and lodged at a Friends Houſe in <hi>Waping</hi> Three Quakers of a Year, and a Week after I was gon came the King's Meſſenger with his Warrant, but I being not at home, he loſt his Labor: He
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62853:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came Three times, and ſaw he could do no good, he gave over coming for a long time.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. After this, in the ſame year; (no ſooner out of one Trouble, but into another) about the Month of <hi>October,</hi> a little before the Parliament ſate, there came Eight or Tenn Men of the Stationers, and other Officers to my Houſe, to ſearch for Books.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But it hapened that my Wife was newly gon out, elſe they would have taken away many Books, to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Value; but ſhe being not at home, went away very angry, ſaying they would take ſome other Courſe; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this I took and got all the Books out of my Houſe: By this means I prevented them from taking away any more for many years.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Theſe Troubles, and many more, I went through in the year 1670. and in the year of my Life 60. And in the 19th. year of my Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And while I was in theſe Troubles, and abſent from my own Houſe, even as a Priſoner, for Three Quarters of a year, there did ariſe a great Rebellion and Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Beleivers, of me, which was like the Conſpiracy and Rebellion of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The Heads of this Rebellion were theſe, <hi>William Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> the elder, Scrivner; <hi>Thomas Burton,</hi> a Flax Man Mr. <hi>Witall,</hi> Brewer; <hi>Walter Bohanan,</hi> Scotchman.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Theſe drew a many Beleivers to ſide with them for a Seaſon: Some of theſe Rebels, Two of them I did excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and the other Two I gave Sentance of Damnation to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And gave Charge to all thoſe that ſided with them in their Conſpiracy, not to Trade, nor Eate, nor Drink with thoſe Men any more, upon the pain of being Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated out of my Preſonce; which the People did obey, and were ſetled in Peace again.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Likewiſe one of theſe Conſpiritors, namely <hi>Thomas Burton,</hi> came and humbled himſelf, and acknowledged his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62853:73"/>
Fault, and I forgave him, and received him into my Favour again.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. There is the whole Relation left upon Record in Writing, in a Volume by it ſelf: Which is as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. William Medgate, <hi>in his Rebellion, ſent unto me Nine Aſſertions, as he calls them, being contrary to all Truth, as he ſaith, and againſt all ſober Reaſon, being</hi> verbatim, <hi>as follows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God taketh no Notice of his Saints, nor doth not mind them at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That you are not to mind God at all, but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet only.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You muſt pin your Faith upon the Prophet's Sleeve, or elſe you can have no true Peace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Altho the Saints give Sentance againſt Blaſphemy, if the Party comes to the Prophet he can take it off.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Altho a Man have a corrupt Nature, and defraud and deceive all Men, yet if the Prophets Love be in him, he will uphold him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Tho falſe Worſhip be an Idol, yet with the Prophet's Leave he may go to that Worſhip blameleſs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To whom the Prophet gives the Bleſſing it ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, altho his Life and Converſation be wicked.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If the Prophet ſhould diſown the Commiſſion of the Spirit, all thoſe that beleives it ſhould be damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And laſtly, That after the Bleſſing is given to any by the Prophet, yet though they walk contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yet they ſhall be damn'd but to the Graves Mouth.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Three firſt Aſſertions Anſwered.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW theſe Aſſertions ſeemed very ſtrange to many of the Beleivers, as they were laid down together, but being interpreted apart, they became eaſy to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all, as may appear: As Firſt, of God's taking no Notice of his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For if God did take Notice of all Actions, there would be a preſent ephect of Bleſſing and Curſing, as in times paſt; neither can either Saint or Devil prove he doth take any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him at all, but as he doth vainly imagin, becauſe his Thoughts doth ſometimes accuſe him, when he doth evil, and excuſe him when he doth well.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thus far I do acknowledge, that God doth take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and minde particular Saints here on Earth; that is, when God hath any Work to do for a perticular Saint, or any perticular Devil, then God taketh perticular notice of Saint or Devil, if it be one or more, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But no Man now upon Earth, can truly ſay that God hath minded, or taken notice of him, but my ſelf only: Alſo I do acknowledge that God doth take notice and minde every perticular Saint, and every perticular Devil, in the Original, as will appear thus.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God hath written the Law in every Man's Heart, both Saint and Devil, and this Law is God's Watchman, and ſtands in God's Place and Stead, both to acquit and condemn the Conſcience of every Man; and where this Law doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62853:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God doth acquit, and where this Law doth condemn, God condemns, yet God's Perſon minds it not, but leaveth the whole Power to the Law, to juſtify or condemn; only God's Power is to be ſeen, and to be taken notice of, when he ſhall raiſe the Man again, and that Law in his Heart ſhall quicken again by Gods Power, and ſhall ſtand as God, to judge, to juſtify, or condemn the Conſcience of every Man.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So that if a Man have not true Faith in his Heart to juſtify his Perſon in the ſight of God, while on Earth, to free him from that Law of Sin and Death writen in his Heart, then in the Reſurrection that Law writen in his Heart ſhall quicken again, and ſhall ſtand as God and Judge, to condemn him to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Therefore I may ſay unto you Rebels, as God did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt not thou be rewarded, and if thou doſt Evil Sin lyeth at the Door of thy Conſcience;</hi> for the Law ſaid in his Heart, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> And ſhall not your Act of Rebellion ly at the Door of your Conſciences, as ſure as <hi>Cain's</hi> Murther lay at the Door of his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Therefore it was that <hi>Paul</hi> did thank God, that he was delivered from the Law of Sin and Death, and ſo doth every Man that is delivered from that Law writen in his Heart: And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thy Heart condemn thee not, then haſt thou Confidence to the Throne of Grace, but if thy Heart condemn thee, God is greater than thy Heart, and knoweth all things:</hi> That is, if the Law writen in a Man's Heart do condemn a Man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal Damnation, God is greater than this Law, and knoweth how to raiſe you again, and to condemn you to eternal Torments.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus in the Original, God taketh notice, and mindeth Saints and Devils here on Earth, by the Law writen in their Hearts; and if the Saints grow in Faith, Love and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, then is Conſcience juſtified in the Sight of God, becauſe the Prophet and Meſſenger of God juſtifies the Saints Faith to be true Faith.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But if the Prophet doth not juſtify a Man's Faith to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62853:75"/>
be a true Faith, nor him to be a true Saint, neither will God do it, and that Man's Heart will condemn him alſo.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For it is a true Prophet, or true Miniſter that maketh a Saint, one or more, for a Saint cannot maketh a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor true Miniſter, but a Prophet may make a wicked Sinnor a glorious Saint, as I have done ſeveral: As Chriſt, he could make ſimple ignorant Men Apoſtles, but Apoſtles could not make him their Chriſt, ſo that no Prophet no Saint.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. They may be elected Veſſels, but not Saints, for no Man can probably be ſaid to be a Saint, except they come actually to beleive in a true Prophet, true Apoſtle, or true Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And further, I ſay, whoever doth not ſtand in Awe, and Fear to offend that Law of Conſcience, as if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did ſtand by and take notice of all his Actions, ſo he doth well, becauſe God's Eye is over him, elſe not: I ſay all ſuch a Man's Doings is but Eye Service, and reſpected of God no more than the cuting of a Doggs Neck, and that Man is in the depth of Darkneſs; but ſuch a Man, if he doth Evil, then he deſires God to take no notice of that, but to blot it out of his Remembrance; as if God were beholding to Man to do well, when as there is a Bleſſing in Well doing, and a Curſe in Evil doing.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For this I ſay, if there were no God to reward the Good, nor puniſh the Evil, yet could I do no otherways than I do; for I do well, not becauſe I expect any Reward from God, and I refrain from Evil, not for fear God ſhould ſee me, or ſeeing me, will puniſh me, or that his Perſon doth take notice or mind me in it at all; but I do well, and refrain from Evil, to pleaſe the Law writen in my Heart, ſo that I might not be accuſed in my own Conſcience, by that Law writen in my Heart, as God hath placed for a Watchman, to tell me when I do well, and when I do ill.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. So I being juſtified by Faith in my own Conſcience, and being not condemned by the Law writen in my Heart, I have Confidence to the Throne of Grace. Neither do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62853:75"/>
from Evil, for fear God ſeeing me, and ſo to puniſh me; but I refrain from Evil, becauſe the Law in my Heart ſeeth all my doings, and that Watchman God hath ſet there to watch me will tell God of all my Doings, and that Law will be the only Accuſer of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So that God needs not to trouble himſelf to watch over every Man and Woman's Actions himſelf, but hath placed his Law, a Watchman in every Heart, as above ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thus in the Original, God taketh Notice by his Law: Not that I do own the Law writen in Man's Heart to be the very God, as the Quakers do, but God is a diſtinct Perſon of himſelf, and diſtinct from this Law: And no other ways doth God mind or take notice, now at this time, but by this Law.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And to that Second Aſſertion, how the Saints are not to mind God at all, it is plain, and is Truth alſo, as by Scripture appears, how that he that receiveth a Prophet in God's Name, receiveth him that ſent him: And ſeeing God doth not come to treat with Men himſelf, he ſends his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Embaſſador in his ſtead, and he is impowred by him to make Peace between God and Man, upon ſuch Articles as the Prophet and the People can agree on: And thus.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Whoever beleives the Prophet's Report ſhall be ſaved, and he that doth not beleive his Prophet's Report ſhall be damned. Therefore it is ſaid by <hi>Eſau,</hi> who hath beleived our Report, and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed. So that God hath placed the whole Power in the Prophet, to determin upon Life and Salvation, as if God was preſent himſelf, and if the People do not agree with the Prophet while he is in the way, how ſhall a Man make his Peace with God.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For God will ſay to ſuch that ſhall think to come to him, and diſpiſe the Prophet; If you would not receive the Prophet whom I ſent, you will not receive me, if I ſhould come my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62853:76"/>21. So that God doth not expect that you ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but unto the Prophet only; neither doth he own your coming unto him; for he will ſay, you ſhould have minded my Prophet, and have beleived him, and have made your Peace with him, and then I would have accepted of you; for it will be ſaid to you as it was unto <hi>Dives, They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So it will be ſaid to you, if you believe not my laſt Prophet whom I ſent; he hath ſpoken unto you, and hath declared Life and Salvation unto you, and if you will not believe him on Earth, you will not believe if God himſelf ſhould come from Heaven and ſpeak unto you.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. So that there is a neceſſity that Men ſhould believe the Prophet only: Theſe Things are common Practices with the Kings of the Earth: Would a King be well pleaſed with that Man that rejects his Embaſſador? For doth not an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſtand in the King's place, and what he doth the King doth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Why ſhould you that are Men think it ſtrange to mind the Prophet only: Were not all thoſe People bleſſed that minded the Prophets only, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and thoſe that did not mind the Prophets only, were they not curſed.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. So likewiſe whoever mindeth the Prophet now alive only, ſhall have true Peace with God; and whoever doth not, ſhall never have true Peace with God, nor perfect Peace in his own Soul; for this is God's way, and that Honour he hath put upon Prophets for all their Sufferings, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of ſuch as bring glad Tideings of Peace and Salvation? And whoever receiveth a Prophet ſhall receive a Prophet's Reward?</hi> Which Reward is no leſs than the Bleſſing of everlaſting Life; and if ſo, ſure ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ought to be Received while on Earth, to be minded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing that he that receives him receives God; and in this Sence People ought to mind the Prophet only, and no other ways.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And as to the Third Aſſertion, my Anſwer is this, <hi>I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62853:76"/>
ſay it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman to have true Peace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they do pin their Faith upon the Prophet's Sleeve.</hi> Why? why becauſe the Prophet repreſents the place of God, nay God himſelf; and he that doth believe a Prophet's Report, he believeth in God; for ſuch a one reſteth his Soul only upon the Prophet's Words: Now if a Prophets Word's be Truth, then a Man that believes reſts his Soul upon the Truth; and this is ſeting the Seal that he is true.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And ſo it may be ſaid, a Man pins his Faith upon the Prophet's Sleeve, that if he be true my Faith is true, if he be falſe, my Faith is falſe alſo; and if he be a falſe Prophet, then he ſhall be damn'd, and he that believes him will be damn'd alſo.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For if a Man be ſaved by pining his Faith upon a true Prophet's Sleeve, ſo by pining his Faith upon a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet a Man is damn'd; this muſt and is ventured by ſome: For this I ſay, there is no Man upon Earth, that profeſſes the Chriſtian Religion, but he hath either a true Faith, or a falſe Faith, and he pins his Faith upon either a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a falſe Miniſter's Sleeve; and he loveth one Teacher better than another, and here he pins his Faith, and hath Peace ſo long as his Faith holds there.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But when his Faith faileth, the Pin looſeneth and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth quite out, ſo their Faith and that Preacher is parted, and that Peace he had in that Faith is loſt, and another Faith ſought after; for no Man in the World can live but by a true Faith, or a falſe Faith, ſo that all Men in the World doth or muſt pin their Faith upon ſome Mans Sleeve or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or elſe there can be no Peace at all.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. But when their Faith faileth, the Peace they had in that Faith is loſt, and another Faith ſought after, which Faith pitches upon the dead Letter of the Scriptures, which yields no Peace at all without an Interpretor.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Thus all Men in the World muſt and do pin their Faith upon ſome Man's Sleeve or other, elſe there can be no Peace at all to the Mind of Man; and in this ſence the Saints muſt pin their Faith upon the Prophets Sleeve, elſe they can have no true Peace at all.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Aſſertions anſwered.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. TO this Fourth Aſſertion, I ſay, Who made any of you Saints, but the Prophet only? For as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no Prophet, no Saint; for though Men and Women be elected in the Seed, in God's electing Power, and may be ſaved by Election, yet they cannot properly be called Saints, as aforeſaid, becauſe he muſt firſt come actually to believe in a true Prophet, or true Miniſter of Chriſt; for a Saint can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Prophet, but a Prophet can make a wicked Man a Saint, as I have done ſeveral.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Furthermore, who gave any Saint, in theſe our Days, power to give Sentance upon any Man for Blaſphemy, was it not the Prophet now alive.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God gave the Saints no ſuch Power, neither did <hi>John Reeve</hi> give any ſuch Power to any Saint all his Days of his Life, neither did any Saint give Sentance upon any all his Days.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now ſeeing the Saints receive their Power to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Blaſphemy, from the Prophet now alive, and not from God; ſure then there is a Power in that Prophet to take off that Sentance that any Saint ſhall give, in caſe the Party ſo ſentanced comes unto the Prophet, and the Prophet deſerns him capable of true Sorrow for his raſh Speeches, the Prophet can take off that Sentance that any Saint hath given, and ſhall have perphect peace of Mind, as if no Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all had been paſſed upon him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There hath been an Example of this both in <hi>John Reeve</hi>'s time, and ſince; for it came to paſs that <hi>John Reeve</hi> had paſſed the Sentance upon a Man for writing blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Words upon the Marjant of the Commiſſion Book, and when the Man read the Sentance he was exceedingly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62853:77"/>
troubled all that Night, ſo that no Reſt could be found: So that he came in the Morning, with the Sentance in his Hand, and beſought us with Tears, upon his Knees, to take this Writing again, for, ſaid he, <hi>I have done fooliſhly, and ſpoken raſhly before he had conſidered;</hi> with ſeveral other Words of Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So <hi>John Reeve,</hi> ſeeing his Sorrow for this Sin, he took the Writing from the Man again; and the Man was ſetled in Peace of Mind, as at firſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now if the Prophet <hi>Reeve</hi> had Power to take off his own Sentance for Blaſphemy, then much more can he take off the Sentance that any Saint ſhall give againſt Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Another Example ſince it, was ſo; That <hi>Claxton</hi> gave Sentance of Damnation upon Mrs. <hi>Maſſon;</hi> and he was, at that time, as knowing a Saint counted by the Beleivers, as ever any of you were; yet when her Husband cauſed her to apply her ſelf unto the Prophet: I underſtanding the Cauſe, I took off that Sentance he had given her; and not only ſo, but for that and other Things, I took away his Power alſo, ſo that no Sentance of his afterwards ſhould be of any Value to any Man.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So that Prophets have a prerogative Power, as God, above the Power of Saints; becauſe the Power of a Saint is at the ſecond hand, ſubordinate to the Power of a Prophet; and therefore a Prophet hath power to take off that Sentance, where and on whom he pleaſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And as to the Anſwer of the Fifth Aſſertion, this I ſay, Who ſhould uphold a corrupt natured Man but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in caſe a corrupt natured Man do beleive the Prophet, then the Prophet's Faith ſhall uphold him from the Senſure and Judgments of thoſe that looks upon their own Natures to be more pure and uncorrupt, as to his Happineſs in the Life to come, the Prophets Love being in him, he will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And whereas you ſay, <hi>defraud and deceive all Men,</hi> to this I ſay, I do not uphold no Man to defraud nor deceive any Man; it was always contrary to my Nature, to uphold
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62853:78"/>
any ſuch Practice in any Saint or Devil, becauſe I never did practice any ſuch Things my ſelf; not in the Days of my Ignorance.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But in caſe ſome Mens Natures are ſo corrupt, as to practice ſuch Things, and yet are true Believers, what ſhall the Prophet do with ſuch Men, ſhall he caſt them out of the Kingdom of Heaven for ever, becauſe his Nature is corrupt, ſurely no?</p>
                  <p>For this was not the Practice of Chriſt when on Earth: But this I do allow and tollerate every Saint, that if they cannot freely forgive the Defraud and Deceivings of ſuch natured Men, they may take the Law of them: The Law is open to Right him ſelf that is deceived, or elſe let them truſt ſuch Men no more.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But this I ſay, I think you Fault Finders are the leaſt defrauded, or deceived by thoſe corrupt natured Men of any: Prophets cannot give Men honeſt Hearts, that are not honeſt by nature; and if they be honeſt by nature, Prophets can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give them Mony to uphold their Honeſty.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Neither can a Prophet change corrupt Natures, for if the Prophet could I would have changed yours, and have made you more Merciful to forgive the Treſpaſs of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your own Faith, and not to rake up the Sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and lay them as a Charge againſt the Prophet, as if he were the cauſe of their Defraud and Deceit, becauſe I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in Peace of Mind, concerning the Life to come, my Faith being in him it ſhall uphold him, ſo that the fear of eternal Death ſhall not ſurprize him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Alſo, if I could have changed your corrupt Nature, I would never have ſuffered it to have broken forth into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellon, as it hath done, but would have upheld you in Peace of Mind, and Hope of eternal Life, notwithſtanding your Nature is corrupt enough; yet while my Love was in you I did uphold you in peace of Mind, but now my Love is taken from you, through your Rebellion, your Peace, Hope, and Aſſurance, will weather and dye in you: And in this Sence will he uphold corrupt natured Men if his Love be in him.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:62853:78"/>16. The Sixth Aſſertion anſwered, which ſaith, <hi>Tho' falſe VVorſhip be an Idol, yet with the Prophets Leave he may go to that VVorſhip blameleſs:</hi> As to this, I never did forbid any Believer of this Commiſſion of the Spirit from going to Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>John Reeve</hi> in his time, they all went to Church, or to Meetings; <hi>John Reeve,</hi> nor I never laid any Injunction upon any Believer, not to go to Church.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But ſince I wrote the Book of the whole Revelation, I had occaſion to write concerning Worſhip, and the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reading of it, their Eyes were opened to ſee it was Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to worſhip as the Nation doth, ſo that many of them refrained from it, and they found much Peace in it; but ſome could not refrain, becauſe of Perſecution; but thoſe that did refrain had much Peace in themſelves, and were better beloved with me, than the other which did go to Church: So that they that did go to Worſhip, they had Shame and Trouble, and Doubting in themſelves; and I let them bear their own Sin, and never reproved them for it.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And becauſe I did not adviſe, nor command them to the contrary, they were the more incouraged; but had not that Peace in themſelves as thoſe had that did refrain, not becauſe of my Diſlike, but becauſe of their own Peace of Conſcience: But having no Command from us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſome few took leave, that were in high Places, which could no ways uphold their Honour and Livelyhood, except they went ſomtimes to Church.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Now thoſe not being forbid by the Prophet, they were not diſobedient to the Prophet, nor to God, but to their own Souls, they brought Guilt upon their Conſcience and Fear upon their Mind; yet by the Prophets winking at them as God did in the Days of old at there Ignorance, and not accuſeing them of Evil, but continueing his Law in them; the Prophet Remembring their former Faith and Love to <hi>John Reeve:</hi> They are blameleſs as to the fear of Eternal Damnation, and why, becauſe the Prophet did never forbid them, nor never did Condemn them for any thing they had done in that Nature.</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62853:79"/>20. And in this Sence they are blameleſs of the Prophet and blameleſs of God, for a Prophets Power is unlimited as God's Power is: None is to call a Prophet to an Account but God only, for if the Prophet will Wink at the faileings of ſome upon conſideration of the Snares great Men are in, and of other good they do, and the Prophet will not Wink at others that are not under ſuch Snars of this World, nor can do no Good to others of their own Faith, who ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſay it, none but Rebels.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 They will undertake to be more Righteous then the Prophet, they would make all the Lords People Holy, if they where in the Prophets place, by Reproving and Exhorting and Judging the People, ſome for going to worſhip an Idol, and others for defraud and deceit, but if we were in his place, we would give Righteous Judgment upon all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to demerit, without reſpect of perſons, this is <hi>Corath, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> like, the practies of Rebels.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And in this Sence thoſe that go to worſhip an Idol may be ſaid to be blameleſs of the Prophet, and no other ways.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Aſſertions Anſwered.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. HOW ſhould Men that do Evil after the Bleſſing is given be ſupported, if the Prophet ſhould not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, ſuppoſe ſome that are under the Bleſſing may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Mony of his Brethren of the ſame Faith, and never pay them again, others perhaps are paſſionate, haſty natured, which wounds their own Souls, others may ſometimes be drunk, others of a haſty wraſhful Nature as you are.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:62853:79"/>2. Thoſe things are all Evil, the one as well as the other, and perhaps ſome of this Faith to whom the Prophet hath given the bleſſing are guilty of thoſe things; now to whom ſhall they apply them ſelves too, to be ſupported; in the trouble of his Mind he hath borrowed Mony, but cannot pay it again, ſo his Credit is loſt, he can borrow no more there, neither will he forgive him freely, but looks upon him, though he be of his own Faith, but a paltry deceitful Man, and will have no more Dealing with him: This is Puniſhment enough where an honeſt Heart is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And where ſhall ſuch a Man be ſupported but by the Prophet, for his Brethren will not ſupport him, and the World Condemns him for a baſe Cheat, and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Condemns him and makes him aſhamed and where ſhall he go; he cannot go to God for Relief, but to a Man like him ſelf, a Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And to this Prophet he can appeal unto, and be ſupported under his Bleſſing he once gave him, for a Prophets Word is as the Word of God him ſelf, in caſe the Mans Faith be in it: For who hath need of Support but ſuch, for legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men need no Support, neither of God nor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; for it hath a Bleſſing in it ſelf, in the very deed doing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore it is ſaid that Chriſt did Juſtify the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but not the legal Righteous Man, but rather Condemn him, as the Proud <hi>Phariſe,</hi> who boſted of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>and did thank God that he was not like the</hi> Publican <hi>who deceiv'd all Men he delt with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. And in this Sence it may be ſaid, that the Prophet doth uphold a Man, though his Life and Converſation be counted Wicked by Rebels, yet his Faith being ſtedfaſt ſhall be upholden by the Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As to the Eighth Aſſertion, my Anſwer is; ſuppoſe Chriſt when he was taken and carried before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and when he was examined by him whether he was the Chriſt, the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> if Chriſt for fear of Death ſhould have denyed, and ſaid, <hi>No, I am not the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. If
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62853:80"/>
this ſhould have been ſaid by Chriſt, then he would have prov'd a Falſe Chriſt, and his Faith, a Falſe Faith.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And ſo, thoſe that Believed him, their Faith would be Falſe and vain, and the aſſurance of Eternal Life in them would have periſhed, for a Falſe Chriſt will be Damn'd, then all that Believe in that Falſe Chriſt will be Damn'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For it is by Faith that Men are ſaved; now if a Man's Faith be pitched upon the true Chriſt, and hold out to the end, he ſhall be ſaved, becauſe the Chriſt he Believed in ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But if a Man have Faith in the true Chriſt for a while, and afterwards his Faith whither and grow coul'd, and not hold out, this Man may periſh to Eternity, yet the Chriſt ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Furthermore if the Prophet now alive ſhould diſown the Commiſſion of the Spirit; that is, if he ſhould deny and diſown that God ſpoke to <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and that God did not Chuſe us two Joyntly to be his Two laſt Prophets that God will ever ſend to the end of the World, now if it where poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Prophet ſhould diſown this, but it is not poſſible, which way then can thoſe that have believed in us poſſibly be ſaved, but muſt be Damn'd.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For a Falſe Prophet will be Damn'd: And again, if a true Faith Juſtify a Man, being pitched upon a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, then a Falſe Faith pitched upon a Falſe Prophet, it whithers and dies, and Condemns the Heart of Man.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If it ſhould be objected, that we believe <hi>John Reeve,</hi> that God ſpake to him, and we believe his Writings, and that he Dyed in that Faith: But if the Prophet now alive ſhould diſown <hi>John Reeve,</hi> that God ſpake to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet we ſhall be ſav'd, by believing in <hi>John Reeve's</hi> Writings now he is Dead.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This is juſt like the Faith of all the World that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Prophets and Apoſtels that are Dead, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before they where Born, but would not have believed them when they where alive: No more then their

Fathers did: For it is the Nature of Reaſon to believe dead Prophets rather then living Prophets, and it is the Nature of Faith to believe live Prophets rather then dead Prophets, for a living Faith believeth a living Man, but a dead Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth a dead Man, and thus the Seed of reaſon dealeth by me.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But to this I ſay, this Faith will not ſave you, nor do you little good in the Day of Trouble, why, becauſe God did not chuſe <hi>John Reeve</hi> Singuler, but God choſe us two Joyntly, ſo that there could be no ſeperation but by Death, and ſeeing God hath Honoured me to be the longer Liver, he hath given me a double Power, as he did to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> when <hi>Ely's</hi> Mantle fell upon him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So that God hath ſeated and eſtabliſhed the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wholy upon me, ſo that the Prophet now alive doth ſtand in God's place, and doth Repreſent his Perſon to make Peace with Men, neither can any Man have true Peace in his Soul but by caſting himſelf by Faith wholy upon the Prophet that is now alive.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Now if it where poſſible for this live Prophet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the Commiſſion of the Spirit, (but it is not poſſible) then ſhould he be found a falſe Prophet and will be Damned, then all that believes him will be Damned, alſo this muſt be ventured by all Men and Women that are ſaved by Faith in a Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But as Chriſt ſpake many hard Words which made many forſake him: So likewiſe the Prophet hath ſpoken many hard Words as thoſe Aſſertions where by ſome that where his Diſciples were offended at him, and forſooke the Prophet and followed him no more; this hath been the practice of ſome in all Commiſſions.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But Woe will be to all that ſet the Hand of Faith to the Plow of Obedience to the Prophet and look back as <hi>Lots</hi> Wife did, or draw back unto perdition, whoſe Faith doth not hold out to the end that they might be ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And in this Sence, if the Prophet ſhould diſown the Commiſſion of the Spirit, all thoſe that believed him would be Damned.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:62853:81"/>21. As to the Ninth Aſſertion, in anſwer thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Power of a Prophets bleſſing, that though a Man walke contrary to the Commiſſion his Faith is in: Yet the Condemnation of his Conſcience, it ſhall not Reach unto Eternity, but unto the Graves Mouth; why becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance of the Prophets bleſſing is in him and doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, elſe his Sin might make him deſpair of Eternal happineſs, and fear Eternal Torments.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Alſo the Prophet cannot call back his bleſſing again though the Man doth walk contrary to the Commiſſion, whereby his own Conſcience is Wounded and the Prophet Diſhonoured: Yet the Man keeping to the Prophets bleſſing, not Rebeling againſt him, the Prophets Faith and Love abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him will uphold him ſo that the fear of Eternal Death ſhall not ſurpriſe him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23 So that all his Condemnation he hath in his Conſcience, and diſgrace he hath received in this World, it ſhall end in Death, and ſhall never be remembered in the Reſurrection; all his miſdeeds ſhall be buried in the Grave and never riſe again and that Faith he had in the Prophets bleſſing, and the Prophets bleſſing ſhall be raiſed again to the Glorious Eſtate of Saints and Angels.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And there ſhall be no Remembrance in the Reſurrection of any Failings on this ſide of Death, but the Faith he had in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Bleſſing only, ſhall uphold him, and free him from eternal Torments; and this is more than any legal righteous Man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, though his Nature be ever ſo pure.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. So that a Prophet's Bleſſing is of no ſmall weight, nor of any ſmall concernment, but as the Bleſſing of Almighty God; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receiveth a Prophet that is true, receiveth God, and what is the Bleſſing of a Prophet but everlaſting Life.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And ſhall not this ſupport and uphold a Man above all the Frailties of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And in this Sence, he that keeps the Prophet's Bleſſing, tho he be ſubject to many Frailties of Nature, which is contrary to the Commiſſion, yet his Condemnation of Concience ſhall extend no further than the Graves Mouth.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Thus I have given Anſwer to all thoſe Nine Aſſertions which <hi>VVilliam-Medgate</hi> hath drawn up as a Charge againſt me ſaying they are contrary to all Truth and againſt all Sober Reaſon.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of one Sr. <hi>John James</hi>'s Opreſſion of Widow <hi>Brunt,</hi> and of her Death: The Prophet left her Executor, and how he would not ſell his Birthright, but Arreſted Sr. <hi>John James</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: Of his great Troubles and Tryals.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AFter this it came to paſs, that in the Year 1675, and 1676, that great Troubles did perſue me, both upon a Natural and a Spiritual Account, through the Envy of wicked Men, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what doth follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was a certain rich Man, being covetous and cruel, he was a Knight, his Name was called Sr. <hi>John James;</hi> he through his cruelty and covetouſneſs did take away a matter of 30 Foot long, and 4 Foot broad, and a brick Wall that cloſed in this parcel of Ground, and a Pump that ſtood in this Ground, to conſiderable Vallue; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Name was <hi>Deborah Brunt,</hi> and this he lett to another Tenant of his, to make his Yarde wider.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo, this Knight did lett another part of his Yarde to a Timber-Merchant, and this Tenant of his did ſtop up the Light of the poor Widow's Houſe with his Timber, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was a great Hindrance and Loſs to the Widow, in that no Tenant would live in it: This rich Man did, and ſhe could no way deliver herſelf, but her Right was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from her for ever, for this rich Man had ſtated it upon his Two Tenants, and they enjoyed it for a Seaſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It came to paſs, in a while after, this Widow <hi>Brunt</hi> dyed, and I was her Executor; and I performed her Will in every particular, according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and I knowing this rich Man had taken away theſe Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62853:82"/>
mentioned, from the poor Widow, that was her Right; which Widow I had been as a Father unto ſeveral Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and did more for her than her Husband could do for her, had he lived.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So that, I thought in myſelf; I would not, like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phain <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell my Birthright for a Meſs of Pottage, but would gain that the poor Widow had loſt wrongfully; whereupon, I did, according to Law, areſt theſe two Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants for Treſpaſs and Damage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Men I went to Law withal were Three, one was <hi>Denis Swenye,</hi> a notable wicked Devil, the others were <hi>Charles Mall,</hi> and <hi>William Picke;</hi> they were Three inveterate Devils, being incouraged by this rich man: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I proceeded on in the Law, and when they ſaw they were in danger to be overthrown, they uſed all ways poſſible to defer the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And when they Saw that would not do, but that I would bring it to Tryal. They conſulted together, and Summon'd me into the <hi>Spiritual-Court;</hi> thinking to have me Excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, that I might not have the benefit of the Law againſt them; But I ſpent Money in that Court, and kept off their Excomunication, and proceeded in the Common Law to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Tryal.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And when they Saw that would not do, then they Conſpired, and Conſulted with the <hi>Wardens</hi> of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Stationers,</hi> to Search my Houſe for Unlicenced Books; upon which the <hi>Wardens,</hi> brought many <hi>Bookſellers</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and Three of the <hi>Kings Meſſingers</hi> with them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Wife denied to let them come up Stairs, they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with a Weapon, they had, broke open Four Doors that were Lock'd and Boulted, Contrary to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and they took away Four Hundred Books great and ſmall from me, of a conſiderable Value.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. After they had done this, they Conſulted with the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to put me into the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> and Sue me there for <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and get me Excomunicated, that I might not have the Benefit of the Law againſt them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62853:82"/>
for breaking open my Houſe, and Stealing away my Goods.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And for that purpoſe, they got the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Rainsfords</hi> Warrant for to take me; he was a deadly Enemy to me, as will appear in that he would have taken away my Life, if he could, but I defended the <hi>Spiritual-Court</hi> from being Excomunicated, and from his Warrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Executed, or Served upon me, until theſe two Tryals in the Common Law, againſt theſe two Tenants of the rich Mad were ended.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I was forced to be abſent from my own Houſe, for above a Quarter of a Year: I was Entertained by that ever honoured, and true Believer, that young Widdow, <hi>Ann Hall,</hi> I was Entertained by her as an <hi>Angel of God,</hi> when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Believers durſt not; I was kept at her Houſe in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Friends, and Enemyes, not knowing where I was, yet I Employed my Lawyers to manage my Buſineſs in both Courts, and in my abſence they overthrew my Adverſaries, in the two Cauſes aforementioned, in the Common Law, and I received again, that which the rich Man had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with ſome of my Charges again.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But the <hi>Wardens</hi> of the <hi>Stationers</hi> Company, becauſe they could not catch me, though they hunted after me as Blood-Hounds, but could not find me out to Serve their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant upon me; then they preſſed hard in the <hi>Spiritual-Court</hi> to get me Excomunicated, they fearing I might Overthrow them in the common Law, for breaking open my Houſe, and taking my Goods, for they had committed an abſolute Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary and Fellony, by the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. But I being preſſed ſo hard upon, in the <hi>Spiritual-Court,</hi> that it came to this Reſultation in the Court, that if I did not Perſonally appear the next Court Day, then I ſhould be Excomunicated, and being adviſed by him that managed my Buſineſs in that Court, to appear, he ſaying he thought there would be no Danger.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Now by his words I was perſwaded to appear though againſt my own Mind, for I did fear I ſhould be Trappan'd,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62853:83"/>
and as I fear'd it came to paſs, and it proved of woeful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to me; as will appear by what doth follow.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. To omit many Circumſtances, I ſhall Record the Heads, and Subſtance of the whole matter, and as I did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the <hi>Spiritual-Court,</hi> to prevent my ſelf of being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicated; The Court had little to ſay unto me, only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me, <hi>if I did own that Libel,</hi> which they knew I denied by my Procter before.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. This was only to Deliver me into the Temporal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Hand; for the <hi>Wardens,</hi> the Lord Mayor, the Lord Chief Juſtice, together, with the <hi>Spiritual-Court,</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed together to Proceed againſt me this way; otherwayes they could never have catched me while they Lived, nor have brought me under their Law.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Therefore the <hi>Wardens Merne,</hi> and Clark they got the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi>'s Warrant, with a Conſtable ready, and as ſoon as I was Diſcharged in the <hi>Spiritual-Court</hi> at <hi>Docters-Commons,</hi> that curſſed Court is meerly to betray People into the Hands of their Enemies, and to ruin the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Poor People, for it is of no more Conſequence for the good of the Nation, then to throw Stones againſt the Wind.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For the Wickedneſs and Envie of the Ignorant People is ſuch, becauſe they cannot be revenged of the Innocent, and Juſt, by the Temporal Laws of the Land, then they Cite the Innocent, (that cannot Bow Down to their Worſhip) into the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> which I have had great Experance of this curſſed Court, which did betray me into the Hands of wicked envious Magiſtrates, as will appear.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For as ſoon as I was coming out of the Court the Conſtable ſerved the Lord Juſtice <hi>Rainsford</hi>'s Warrant upon me: Then was I delivered into the Hands of <hi>Satan,</hi> to be plain, into the Hands of <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. And I was led to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> before the Lord Mayor, and Court of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> the Mayors Name was <hi>Thomas Davis,</hi> a Stationer by Trade, a deadly Enemy to me, and to all Moral Juſtice, and a Man made up more of Mallice, and Ignorance
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62853:83"/>
of the Law of the Land, than Ntural Wiſdom, or Moral Knowledge: And as to Spiritual Knowledge he was as Blind as a <hi>Beetle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Conſtable gave Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi>'s Warrant into the Lord Mayor's Hand, and the <hi>Wardens</hi> gave the whole Book bound into his Hands; and the Lord Mayor asked me, <hi>whither I did own this Book;</hi> I ſaid <hi>I did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Then he commanded me to withdraw into another Room, and I did ſo with an Officer with me; I ſtay'd a little while and the ſame Conſtable brought my Mittimus from the Lord Mayor, to carry me to the Geoal of <hi>Newgate</hi> until the next Seſſions.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. So I being carried to Priſon, I was Bailed out until the 17th of <hi>January,</hi> in the Year 1676, then did <hi>Merne</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> draw up an Indictment againſt me, but out of one of thoſe Bookes they ſtole from me, called, <hi>The Neck of the Quakers Broken.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. NOW followes the Bill of Indictment, as I was Condemn'd for: The Perſons or Jury Sworn for our Lord the King; gave in that <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi> late of <hi>London</hi> Labourer, being a Man Pernicious, Blaſphemous, Seditious, Heritical, and a Monſter in his Opinions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pretending that he the ſaid <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> is one of the two laſt Witneſſes, of <hi>Almighty GOD,</hi> and deviſing, and intending to Spread Abroad his Pernicious, Blaſphemous, Seditious, and Monſtrous Opinions; and to diſturb the Peace and quiet of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and diſpiſe and debaſe the True Religion, Eſtabliſhed and Exerciſed therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As alſo to make and Excite diſcord, between the King and his Subjects, and to bring into Odium and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,

                  <p n="4">4. He the ſaid <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> on the 30th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> in the 23d Year of His Majeſty's Reign, in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without <hi>Cripplegate London</hi> aforeſaid, by force and Armes, did Unlawfully, Wickedly, Maliciouſly, Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, Blaſphemouſly, Seditiouſly, Sciſmatically, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritically, Write, Print, and Sell, Utter and Publiſh, a certain Malicious, Scandalous, Blaſphemous, Seditous, and Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Book Intituled <hi>The Neck of the Quakers Broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In which Book, Written to <hi>Edward Burne,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe Unlawful, Blaſphemous, Seditious, Heritical, and Scandalous Sentences following, viz. <hi>I Write theſe Lines unto you,</hi> Edward Burne, <hi>knowing you to be the Seed of the</hi> Serpent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6, There was repeated out of this Book much more, as Page the 18, 31, and 54. That whoſoever Reads that Book, may ſee thoſe Blaſphemies, theſe Quakers did firſt Judge me with; ſo that I had cauſe enough given me to Pronounce thoſe ſad Sentences of Damnation upon them, and thoſe Books was known to the Powers of the Nation many Years before, and the Powers of the Nation took no notice of it, becauſe that, and all others were Pardoned by the King, and Act of Parliament, till within three Years, and that Book was Printed 13 Years before.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yet theſe wicked Judges, and Jury and others, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together to perſwade, the Court, that this Book was Antidated 13 Years ago, yet Publiſhed this <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30th 1676, that it might come within the Act of three Years.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now theſe words that were taken out of this Book, made ſome of the Judges Mad with Envie, and grin'd their Teeth, and their Counſel ſaid, <hi>it made his Hair ſtand on an End, he was ſo Affrighted,</hi> which cauſed one of the Judges to belch out of his Mouth, ſaying, <hi>it was to the great contempt and Scandal of their ſaid Lord the King, of His Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. When as that Book did not meddle with their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> at all, neither was it any diſhonour to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62853:84"/>
King, but rather an honour, if he had but Read it over; but Truth doth alwaies offend the reaſon of Man, as is ſeen by what a Multitude of Helliſh Expreſſions, and Palpable lies, uttered in their Indictment, being patch'd up with Reproaches, and Slanders, againſt the pureſt Truth that ever was ſpoken by Prophet, or Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I ſhall now Record now unjuſtly Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> dealt with me before the Tryal: The Seſſions before I was Tryed, the Bill of Indictment was Read in Court, and I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>not Guilty,</hi> and ſaid unto <hi>Davis,</hi> then Lord Mayor, <hi>that I would Traviſs the Indictment, and put in Bail to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. So <hi>Davis</hi> asked whither I could put in three Sufficient Men, that could Swear they were worth Two Hundred Pounds a Man, he would Accept of Bail, thinking I could not have procured ſuch great Security: And Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> Sate at the Right-Hand of the Mayor, and I heard Judge <hi>Rainsford,</hi> ſay to the Lord Mayor, <hi>that it was pitty but I ſhould be Burn'd;</hi> I heard by his Words, and ſaw by his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that he was, and would be a Deadly Enemy.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But the Mayor, could not deny Bail, nor to Traviſs the Indictment by the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> ſo the Men were called, and the Mayor being Envious, asked one of them if they were of my Gang, one of them anſwered and ſaid thus? <hi>Sr. We do not come here to be Examin'd whoſe Gang we are of, but we came to be Bail for this Man for Six Hundred Pounds for his Appearance the next Seſſions;</hi> The Mayor ſaid no more but Accepted it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And when the time drew near, I did according to Law (with my Lawyer) go to this Judge <hi>Rainsford,</hi> and got his Clerk to draw up a <hi>Seſſarary,</hi> which was to remove it out of that Court, into the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> and this En, vious Judge, being Judge of the <hi>Kings-Bench-Court,</hi> and we could not have a <hi>Seſſarary</hi> in any Court elſe, which he knew well enough, which cauſed his Envie to act ſo wickedly and unjuſtly towards me.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For when his Clerk, and my Lawyer had Drawn up
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62853:85"/>
the Writing, and had recived their Money, (near Forty Shillings) they went into the Judges-Chamber, for him to ſet his Hand to it, to remove my Cauſe into his own Court, which was but Law, but he made them anſwer, and ſaid, <hi>he would not ſet his Hand to it, but would hear the Tryal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the Seſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. So I was Cheated of my Money by his Clerk, and he knew it, and he deprived me of it and of the juſt Law, which is the Birth right of every free born <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. But now as to the Tryal, I ſhall in the next place Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſome of the moſt remarkable Words, and Paſſages of the Judges, and the Counſelors, and the Witneſſes againſt me in the Tryal: Upon the 17th of <hi>January</hi> 1676, firſt the Indictment was Read, and the Cryer of the Court, ſaid, <hi>Are you Guilty or not Guilty.</hi>

                  <p n="17">17. I anſwred, <hi>not Guilty,</hi> but deſired the Court to let my Counſel Plead the Cauſe, becauſe I knew they would have taken hold of my Words, and made them a more horrible Crime, then the Book it ſelf; which Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> readily granted, and asked <hi>Who was my Counſel,</hi> I ſaid Mr. <hi>Gener.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. And he received a Breviat of the Cauſe, ſhewing the Wrong I had received by their breaking open my Houſe, and taking away my Goods, contrary to the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Alſo I gave into my Counſels Hands, the Kings Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Act of Pardon; <hi>That whoſoever did Sue any Man for what was Pardoned in that Act afterwards, that the Partie ſo Sued, ſhould Plead the General Iſſue and ſhould Recover Ten Pound a Man of thoſe his Adverſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. This Act was given into my Counſels Hands to Plead, and that Book that ſtated the Indictment out of; was given into his Hand, which Book was Pardoned by that Act, being Printed 13 Years ago, all was Pardon'd till within Three Years.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Alſo their Counſel, (<hi>I</hi> know not his Name;) had one of the Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62853:85"/>21. Therefore I was reſolved to follow the Practice of Chriſt, when Examined by the high Prieſts, Rulers and Counſel, gave them no anſwer neither before <hi>Pilate;</hi> for he knew they watched to catch Words out of his Mouth, that they might have ſome what to Accuſe him of, to make his Cauſe worſe, then what his Enimies did Accuſe him with, as may be Read <hi>Luke</hi> 22.70. where Chriſt held his Peace, and anſwer'd nothing.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Then ſaid they all, <hi>Art thou the Son of God;</hi> and he ſaid unto them? <hi>Yea ſay that I am,</hi> and to this they ſaid, <hi>What need we any further Witneſs, for we our ſelves have heard out of his own Mouth;</hi> ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 14. and in verſe 62, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered and ſaid to his queſtion, <hi>I am the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Then the high Prieſts rent their Cloathes, and they all Condemned him to be guilty of Death; ſo likewiſe I did perceive that if I had pleaded my ſelf I ſhould have Juſtified my Commiſſion from GOD, and that he gave <hi>John Reeve,</hi> and my ſelf that Power and Authority to give Sentance of <hi>Damnation,</hi> to all that Blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as they did, as are Writen in that Book.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Theſe Words would have Enraged the Judges, and Jury, and the People more then that Book; ſo that they would have ſaid by me as the Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſies ſaid by Chriſt as aforeſaid: The angrey and Malicious Judges, and Envious Jury, and Ignorant Officers and People in the Court, would have rent their Hearts with Madneſs againſt me, and ſaid, <hi>What need we to mind this Book, or Indictment, or Witneſs againſt him, for you hear his horrible Blaphemy out of his own Mouth, therefore what think you?</hi> ſo that they all would have Condemned me to greater Torments than they did.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Conſidering this, I held my Peace and ſpeak not one word; which prevented the Expectations of Thouſands, which thought to have had a large Relation of the Matter.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So that I left the Book that was Pardoned, &amp; Act, and Indictment and Witneſſeſs, for them to Judge and Condemn me by; So they had no farther Matter from me at all, which

did fruſterate their Expectations and Moderate their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Reader may perceive by what doth follow.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. UPON the 17th of <hi>January</hi> 1676, after the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was read, my Counſel Pleaded to it, proving that this Book the Indictment was ground upon, it was Pardoned by the Kings Gracious <hi>Act,</hi> being Printed 13 Years ago; neither was this Book Publiſhed, nor Sold in any Shop, or to any Perſon in publick; as can be proved, but were locked up in <hi>Cheaſts, &amp;c.</hi> This with many other Words, according to the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> This my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel pleaded, and my Counſel Sate under Judge <hi>Atkins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And their Counſel Sate under Judge <hi>Rainsford,</hi> and he did hold up the Book in open Court, which Book was the whole Volumn Bound and Claſped: He held one of the Claſpes between his Finger and his Thumb up in the open Court, in oppoſſition to my Counſel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And he expreſſed theſe Words, and ſaid with a loud Voice, <hi>That he did Read one Leaf of this Book and turn'd over another.</hi> But ſaid he, <hi>it was ſo full of Horrible Blaſphemy, that he durſt not Read any further, for the Blaſphemy was ſo great, that it made his Hair ſtand an end, and his Heart to tremble;</hi> with other Expreſſions of Dread and Fear.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As if the very Reading of it would have cauſed God to have parted the Heavens aſſunder, and have Rained down Vengance upon him for Reading it, if he had Read any further: For ſaid he, <hi>It was impoſſible for any Man to Write ſuch a Horrible Blaſphemous Book, in Aſſuming the place of God
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62853:86"/>
upon him,</hi> Except <hi>he went to the bottom of Hell,</hi> for ſaid he, <hi>it is ſo cunningly contrived, that it confounds all the Reaſon in Man,</hi> with many other hedious expreſſions, which I cannot remember.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He ſpoke truth, but knew it not, for the Spirit of Revelation doth deſcend to the bottom of Hell, elſe we could not tell others where it is, and prevent others from falling into it; and as Chriſt himſelf Deſcended into Hell, and quickened again out of it, ſo hath the Spirit of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me deſcended into the bottom of Hell a Thouſand times, and hath quickened out of it again, and hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned many from going into that Place; but I know this Counſeler ſhall go into Hell, that hath no bottom, called a Bottomleſs Pitt, and he ſhall never come from thence, to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Likewiſe indeed the Revelation of Faith in me, hath confounded all the Reaſon in Man, as to Spiritual, and Heavenly matters.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After this my Counſel pleaded again to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; as he did before, but he through extream Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did wrong my cauſe, in two things: Firſt in that he made no mention of the Wardens breaking open four Doors, contrary to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> which was by the Law abſolute Burglary, and the taking away the Books, was abſolute Fellony.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This was in the Forefront of his <hi>Breviat,</hi> and I had repoſed the Buſineſs to him, becauſe I would not plead my ſelf, but he like a deceitful Knave, and fearfull Fool; did not ſpeak one Word of it before the Court; which if he had, it would have put theſe Envious Judges, and Jury to a Nonpluſh, how they could have brought me in Guilty; ſo he ſpoyld my Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For after he had Pleaded the Kings <hi>Act</hi> of Grace, as aforeſaid, he ſaid theſe Words, that he had Pleaded ſo far as the Law would bear him out, but as for the Words, and cauſe of Indictment, he was aſhamed of it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Upon theſe Words, did Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> ſay unto
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62853:87"/>
the Jury, <hi>You ſee that his own Counſel is aſhamed of his Cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Here the Reader may ſee thoſe Words verified, as I have Read, for my Counſel did do at my Tryal thoſe things which he ought not to have done, and he left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done thoſe things which he ought to have done; for he ought to have Pleaded the Breaking open of ſo many Doors, but he left that undone, and to ſay he was aſhamed of my Cauſe, he ought to have left thoſe Speeches undone, and not to have ſpoken them, being not forced by the Court.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And for a Man to take Forty Shillings to Plead a Man's Cauſe, and to ſay he is aſhamed of his Clyants Cauſe; what Man that hath but Moral Reaſon, and Senſe in him, but will ſay ſuch a Counſeler hath no Truth in him.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But Judge <hi>Atkins</hi> ſiting over my Counſel, might ſee the <hi>Breviat</hi> in my Counſels Hand, which cauſed him to ask one of the Witneſſeſs. (his name was <hi>Garat) how did he come by thoſe Books,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>that he did Seize them, as they uſe to do,</hi> the Judge asked <hi>how many there were of them,</hi> he ſaid <hi>a Porters Load;</hi> The Judge asked him where the Books were, he anſwered, <hi>at the Biſhop of</hi> Londons <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Judge asked him again, <hi>if they were all of a ſort, or all of a bigneſs,</hi> he anſwered <hi>no, ſome were great ones, and ſome, leſſer, ſome three or four bound together, and ſome ſingle:</hi> He was asked how many of them great Books that were in the Court, he anſwered <hi>Six</hi> of them; he was asked what was the Price that great Book was ſold for; He anſwered, <hi>Twelve or Fourteen Shillings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15: Now when the two Counſels had done Pleading, and the Witneſſes Examin'd; the aforeſaid Judge <hi>Atkins</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury, you ſee that the Book which the Indictment was grounded upon, was Printed</hi> 13 <hi>Years ago, and is Pardon'd by the Kings Gracious</hi> Act: <hi>Therefore ſaid he, I cannot ſee, by the Lawes of</hi> England, <hi>how you can poſſibly bring this Man in Guilty, therefore Jury look to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Then ſtood up Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That if it was not Law, we will make it Law,</hi> and further ſaid, <hi>who
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62853:87"/>
knoweth but this Raskal might Antidate the Book</hi> 13 <hi>Years ago, and Publiſh it this</hi> 30th <hi>of</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt paſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The Envy of this wicked Judge, made him ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Conſcience, for he knew it was impoſſible for me to do ſuch a thing as to get it Printed ſo lately, for he knew it were thoſe that Stole my Books, publiſhed them.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And further this <hi>Rainsford</hi> vented his Envy exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high and called me <hi>Incorrigable Rogue, that ſhould Aſſume to himſelf to be in Gods place, a Man Pernicious, Blaſphemous, Seditious, Heritical, and a monſter in his Opinions; Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf one of the two Witneſſeſs of Almighty God, to the great Scandal and Contempt of our Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity, as alſo the Religion of this Kingdom rightly Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed:</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>he was Sorry that the Laws of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>were ſo unprovided to Puniſh Crimes of this Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. And further he goeth on in his Rage againſt me and ſaith; <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury, if you do not bring this Man in Guilty, you will be pertakers with him in all his Horrible Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and grand Apoſtiſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Many more hateful Words, with the Fire of Hell, that proceeded from his Heart, and did appear in his Face; his Zeal was great to have me Puniſhed, Nay he thought in his Heart, that Hanging was too good a Death for me, for ſaid he, <hi>This Crime of horrid Blaſphemy</hi> (as he accounted it) <hi>was worſe than Murder, Fellony, or Treaſon;</hi> and was <hi>Sorry that the Laws was ſo unprovided to puniſh ſuch Crimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. I was ſo moved in my mind, to hear this Curſed Devil to Blaſpheme againſt the Holy Spirit that ſent me, and gave me Power to give Sentance of Eternal Damnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Blaſpheming Devils. That I could have wiſhed, that God would have Executed ſome viſſible Vengeance from Heaven upon this Blaſphemous Judge, to have ſmote him with a natural Blindneſs, for I knew he was Spiritually Blind, for I had done wrong to no Man.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Only I had Executed the Commiſſion of God faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in giving Sentance upon all diſpiſing Devils, who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againg the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> This was that Sin the high Prieſts
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62853:88"/>
and Elders committed in Chriſt's time againſt him, in that they ſaid he caſt out Devils by <hi>Belſebub</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. I know this, that Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> would have ſaid the ſame to Chriſt himſelf, had he been in my place, for his Blaſphemy was great, not only againſt me, but againſt God that ſent me, which God he knew not.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Therefore my Anger was kindled againſt him, and deſired an immediate viſſible Vengeance from Heaven upon him, that might have been a viſſible Witneſs, whither God did own him or me.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. But there was a ſecret Voice within me ſaid, thy Commiſſion is Spiritual, and hath to do with the Spiritual and Eternal Eſtate of Mankind; and that all ſuch Perſons are the Seed of the Serpent, and are to receive for their Blaſphemy againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> their Puniſhment in the Life to come, even Eternal Damnation, which is the ſecond Death, where the Worm of Conſcience ſhall never Dye, nor the Fire of Hell ſhall never be quenched to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Then I was quiet and willing to bear all they could do unto me, even to the loſs of my Life.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFTER that Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> had made his Speech to the Jury, then was the Goler commanded to take me away from the Bar and put into a little Room for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after a little ſpace I was called for to the Bar again, and <hi>Jefferies</hi> being then in the Recorders place, that Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Devil, was to give Sentance, and Judgment upon me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And when I did appear before him, a great Fire was

between us, where they did Burn thoſe in the Hand which were Condemn'd to that Puniſhment, but all that was over before I did appear.</p>

And this <hi>Jefferies</hi> Sate in the Judgment Seat, as <hi>Pilate</hi> din againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and I ſtood a Priſoner at his Bar; and when he ſaw my Face, the firſt Words he ſpeak, he called me Impudent Rogue, becauſe my Countenance did not change, nor look ſad, nor asked any Favour of the Court, and ſaid nothing to all their Threats, Revilings, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, whereby they Reproached me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then he asked the Jury, <hi>Is Muggleton Guilty, or not Guilty,</hi> They ſtay'd a little ſpace before they ſpeak; <hi>Jefferies</hi> asked again, <hi>is Muggleton Guilty, or not Guilty,</hi> the Jury <hi>ſaid Guilty.</hi>
                  </p>

ſtood upon the Pillory, to ſhew my Offence, and cauſe of this Suffering, the Words were as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Lodowick Muggleton, <hi>Standeth hear for Writing, cauſing to be Printed, Selling, Uttering, and Publiſhing, a Blaſphemous Book.</hi>

After this Sentance, and Judgment was paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I ſhall Record as ſhort as I can, the manner of the Execution of this Sentance; and how I did ſuffer it, and bear the Curſe of their wicked Wills; for they did make that Law, which was not Law, as <hi>Rainsford</hi> ſaid before, and as Judge <hi>Atkins,</hi> when he ſaw me Condemn'd contrary to Law, he went off the Bench and ſaid, <hi>there were no fair Dealings with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. This Sentance have I Suffered, in every Tittle in the greateſt Rigour that could be inflicted, even beyond their own Law, they made me Ride in a Cart, as a Thief, or a Murtherer, Bareheaded, without Hat or Cap; which never was done in <hi>England</hi> before: I ſtood Bareheaded upon the Pillory, which no Cheat ever did, but were ſuffered to weare a Cap of Steel under another Cap.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I was ſet as a Mark for every one to Throw a Stone at me.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. My Books were offered up in Three Burnt offerings <hi>unto the Unknown God,</hi> as Three Sacrifices before my Face, the ſmoke of them aſſcended into my Noſtrells, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to Cry to Heaven for Vengeance, upon thoſe Great Men of the Earth, that were the cauſe of thoſe Burned-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unto Devils.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And my ſelf was Offered up, as a Sacrifice Three times, to the Rude Multitude: For the People came from the Four Winds, or from the Four Quarters of the Citty, and Subburbs round about; they were for Multitude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Number.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I was maul'd by the People, ſome caſt Dirt, and Mudd out of the Kennel at me; others Rotten Eggs, and Turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

them) at my Head, which if they had lighted upon me, would have done the Work, as they deſired.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. I was Bruiſed and Battered, and my Innocent Blood was ſhed, tho' not unto Death, for Gods Cauſe, for that the Blood of the laſt True Prophet, and Witneſs of the Spirit, hath been ſhed, by this Bloody Citty, for my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Commiſſion of God, put upon me.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And it was the wonderful Providence of God, my Life was preſerved; for I was delivered into the Hands of unreaſonable Men, the rude Multitude, by the Hands of <hi>Rainsford, Davis,</hi> and <hi>Jefferies,</hi> Judges of the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Jury, theſe were the Men that were Guilty of my Innocent Blood.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. I was willing to be ſtoned to Death, by the rude Multitude, and would have gone off the Pillory to be ſtoned to Death, but the Officers would not let me come down, when this was over, my Wounds and the Blood ſtanched, I was put into the Cole Cellar again, the ſame Day at Night, I went Three pair of Stairs high to my Lodging.</p>
                  <p n="20">20 And the next Day, I would willingly have kept my Bed, but the Keeper ſaid, <hi>If I would not come down into the Cellar in the Afternoon, they would put me in the Common Side;</hi> ſo I was forced into the Cellar, who had more need to have kept my Bed.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But there is no mercy in Priſon, therefore it may well be compared to Hell, for in Hell there is no mercy, but Juſtice only, neither is there any mercy in Priſon Keepers at all without profit.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. After I had ſuffered theſe things, I was put into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon again for the Fine of Five Hundred Pounds that was laid upon me to Pay, but I did lye in Priſon Six Months after I had ſuffered theſe things aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And now in my Impriſonment, I conſidered that my ſufferings were much like unto the ſufferings of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Chap 11.19. he ſuffered for his Meſſage from the <hi>Lord of Hoſt, the mighty God of Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. And my ſufferings was for my Commiſſion received
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62853:90"/>
from the high and mighty God, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, in Glory, the only wiſe God my King and my Redeemer.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And as his Enemies, that cauſed him to ſuffer, and would have had him put to Death, were Princes, and great Men of the Earth; ſo likewiſe, thoſe my Enemies, were great Men, and as Princes on the Earth; and they ſat upon the Thrones, as Gods on Earth, in Judgment againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And as it was with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſo it was with me, for I was like a Lamb, that is brought to the Slaughter, and I knew not that they had deviſed devices againſt me, if I had, I could have prevented them. They ſaying, <hi>Let us deſtroy the Tree with its Fruite thereof, and cut him off from the Land of the Living, that his Name may be no more Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. That is, <hi>let us deſtroy this</hi> Muggleton, <hi>the Tree, and the Fruit thereof; his Doctrine of the True God, and Right Devil in his Writings, that none may receive his Writings more, nor believe his Doctrin, or Commiſſion, that he hath Power from God, to Bleſs, and Curſs to Eternity</hi> any more: This Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Men have practiſed againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. So that I have had Cauſe, to make my Complaint unto my God, my King, and my Redeemer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. <hi>Oh Lord God of Truth, that Judgeth Righteouſly, that Tryeth the Reins, and the Heart, let me ſee thy Vengeance on them, for thou knoweſt I have been Faithful in Executing thy Commiſſion, the Burthen of the Lord, which thou dideſt lay upon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>And thou knoweſt the unrighteous, unjuſt Judgments, theſe wicked unjuſt Judges gave againſt me: They were not only Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to me, but thy Enemies, Oh God; for they have hated me without a cauſe, and they have ſaid, let us ſmite him with the Tongue, with Lyes, Slanders, and Reproaches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Therefore heed, O Lord God of Truth, and harken to the Vioce of theſe wicked Judges, and Jury, and all thoſe that aſſented to that Judgment for harm, that contended with me: And let me ſee thy Vengeance on thoſe thy Enemies, for their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62853:90"/>
Fathers did unto thee when thou was upon Earth, as theſe do unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. <hi>Thou haſt ſaved me from Bloody Men: For they laid wait for my Soul to Kill it, had the Law been provided with Strength, and not for any Tranſgreſſion of any Law that I had broken, but for thy Commiſſion and Doctrine thou gaveſt me to declare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. <hi>Therefore Oh Lord God of truth! be not merciful unto any wicked Tranſgreſſion, that Perſecuteth only for Conſcience ſake; it being the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. <hi>And God will let me ſee my deſire upon my Enemies, and bring them down, Oh Lord my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. This was my ſecret Supplication unto my God, when I was Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> after I had ſuffered all thoſe Corporal Puniſhments, which they Sentanced me to Suffer.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Shewing how that the Prophet in a ſhort time, ſaw his deſire (unto God) in part fullfilled.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AND a little while after theſe my Sufferings I ſaw my deſire (in part) granted, and ſeveral of my Potent Enemies cut off this Earth by Death: As firſt that certain rich Man that took away poor Widdow Brunt's Ground, as is aforemention'd; he was call'd Sr. <hi>John James</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And notwithſtanding I had overthrown his two Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in the common Law, yet when he ſaw that I was in Priſon, and Condemn'd for thoſe Books, and had ſuffered as aforeſaid, yet I being Fined Five Hundred Pounds, he thought I could not be delivered out of Priſon no more, the Fine was ſo great.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereupon he wickedly took advantage upon my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62853:91"/>
ſufferings for God's Cauſe, and ſent a Writt of Ejectment to my Tenants, to Eject me out of Poſſeſſion, ſo my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney Read it and ſaid, <hi>I muſt anſwer to it, elſe he would Eject me out the next Term,</hi> ſo I was forced to Imploy a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter to anſwer to it, which wickedneſs of his, coſt me three Pounds.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And my Lawyer went to Treat with him, and this Knight was not very well, very Croſs, and ſaid, <hi>he had turn'd his Buſineſs over to his Atturney:</hi> And his Atturney was ſo full of Imployment that nothing could be done.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So I hearing by my Lawyer that he was Sick, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God, that he might never come down from that Bed of Sickneſs, whereon he lay; and in a few Days after, it came to paſs, that he Dyed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So our Law Suite was ended, I had been a quarter of a Year in Priſon then, now I knew this Man was the Seed of the Serpent, a Devil, and will be Damn'd to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After this, there was another great Enemy, his Name was <hi>Garret,</hi> he was one of thoſe that broke open my Houſe, and Stole my Books, and was a Witneſs againſt me in the Court: He brought the Books to the Court, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hang Man to Burn, every Day I ſtood upon the <hi>Pillory,</hi> my Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> gave him the Sentance of Damnation to Eternity, and he Dyed Six Weeks after.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The third Perſon, was Judge <hi>Rainsford,</hi> Chief Judge of <hi>England,</hi> he was an Implacable Enemy to me, but in a little time after his Judgment upon me, before I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of Priſon, he was put down from his Seat of Juſtice, and all his Temporal Power was taken from him by the King; and another put in his Place: And the King would give no Reaſon for it, but his own will.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So that his great Power, Honour and Glory, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, and he had not ſo much Power as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice of Peace, he was in the ſame Condition as King <hi>Saul</hi> was, the good Spirit of Power of giving Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment in Temporal Things according to Law was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62853:91"/>
departed from him, and an Evil Spirit of Shame and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace was ſent unto him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Which Troubled his Soul, ſo that in a little time after he Dyed, and went to the ſame place, as King <hi>Saul</hi> did, that did enquire of a Witch that was rejected of God, and not of his Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> And I am ſure he ſhall be rejected of God, even this <hi>Rainsford,</hi> and rejected of me, the laſt True Prophet of the Lord, and that he will be Damn'd to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And he ſhall Remember in the Reſurection, that his Damnation is the very ſame which he called horrible Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which he Judged me for, and ſaid <hi>he was ſorry the Laws of</hi> England <hi>were ſo unprovided to Puniſh me no worſe than they did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. And as he had no Mercy for me when he was in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, neither have I any Mercy for him; and I am ſure God will have no Mercy for him, but hath provided a Law to Puniſh him for his Envy againſt me, who did him no wrong.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And his Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt which God hath ſaid, and made it a Law (never to be altered) that ſhall never be forgiven in this World, or in the World to come: This is the Law that God hath provided for us, the Two laſt Prophets and Witneſſeſs of the Spirit to Judge by; ſo that I know the hotteſt of Hell Fire will be his Portion, and Reward, for his Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Fourth great Enemy to me was Sr. <hi>Thomas Davis,</hi> then Lord Mayor, he being a Stationer himſelf, he was Confedrate with the whole Company of Stationers, and Bookſellers, and Jury: To Fight againſt the Lord and his Choſen Prophet, and Witneſs of the Spirit, which did In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Court and Jury, that I might Antidate that Book 13 Years ago, and yet Publiſh it this <hi>Auguſt;</hi> even againſt his own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Wherein he ſhewed himſelf of that wicked reprobate Seed of the Serpent, a Son of the Devil, and I certainly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62853:92"/>
know him to be a Devil, and that he will be Damn'd to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And about two Years and a half after he Judged me, he Dyed and paſſed through this firſt Death, which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, into the ſecond Death, which is Spiritual, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Theſe great Enemies, I have lived to ſee them cut off from the Land of the Living, with many others more Inferiour Devils, which were my Enemies, have I ſeen cut off by Death, and ſome to Poverty.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. There is one more, that is yet alive, that I deſire of God to have Executed ſome viſſible Vengeance at my Tryal; his Name was <hi>Jefferies</hi> Recorder of <hi>London:</hi> He was the Man that ſate in the Judgment Seat, and gave Sentance againſt me; He uſed ſeveral Scurrilous, and Diſdainful Expreſſions, in the Sentance he gave upon me.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. He was a Man, whoſe Voice was very lou'd, but he is one of the worſt of Devils in Nature, for he is not only an Enemy to God, and all Righteous Men, but an Enemy to all Moral Juſtice and Equity.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For if a Mans Cauſe be never ſo juſt, except he be Imploy'd in it, he will be ſure to baffel and make quabbles, and wrangle out the juſteſt Cauſe that is, and will make that which is unjuſt it ſelf to be right by Law, were it not for more juſter Judges that have a more juſt Conſcience then he hath, elſe the Innocent would always looſe his juſt right, if he be againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But that which I have againſt him is for his Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Holy Spirit that ſent me, and his wicked Malice and Envy againſt me, when he ſate in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; That he ſaid <hi>he was ſorry the Laws of</hi> England <hi>were ſo unprovided to Puniſh Crimes of this Nature, he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Laws could not Impower him to give Sentance of Death upon me:</hi> This I know was the Deſire of his Heart.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And as he was ſorry the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided to Puniſh me, ſo in like manner, am I glad that the Laws of Heaven is always provided to Puniſh him with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62853:92"/>
Eternal Torments, which is a Living Death, and a Dying Life, it is well for me, and all the Elect, that Gods Laws are always provided to give Sentance of Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon all ſuch diſpiſing perſecuting Blaſpheming Devils as this <hi>Jefferies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. I knew he was a Reprobate and appointed of God to be Damn'd before: But this Tryal of mine hath given Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to me and all that truely believe me, that he is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Devil in Fleſh, and his Sin doth cry to Heaven for Vengeance.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And look what meaſure he would have meaſured unto me, in that he would have ſlain my Innocent Blood unto Death, the ſame meaſure ſhall be meaſured to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe the Laws of Heaven are always provided, and hath Impowered me to give Sentance, and Judgment upon him, for I know, by Revelation of the Spirit of God, that he is Recorded in the Tables of Heaven for a Reprobate Devil, and he ſhall be Recorded here on Earth to the end of the World for a Damn'd Devil.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For that Body of his, which is now his Heaven, which Cloathed it ſelf in Scarlet, and ſat on the Judgment Seat againſt me, ſhall be in Hell. And that lofty bauling Spirit of his ſhall be his Devil, the one ſhall be as Fire, and the other as Brimſtone, Burning together to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And he ſhall remember in the Reſurrection, when he is Raiſed again, that he gave Judgment upon me for Writing this Sentance to others, and I am ſure the God of Heaven will not deliver him from thoſe Eternal Torments.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. There is a Neceſſity, that theſe Men of all others, ſhould be Damn'd to Eternity? For there was more Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt me then could be Numbered through the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of theſe Five Men aforementioned.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And I could freely forgive the rude Multitude, for they knew not what they did, but there is no forgiveneſs of theſe Five Men, nor Jury, nor Judge, nor Officers,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62853:93"/>
that gave their conſent to that Judgment that was paſſed upon me the 27th of <hi>January</hi> 1676.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Therefore I have left theſe Five Men upon Record, that the Age to come, may ſee the wickedneſs of them; and take heed how they Perſecute Innocent Men, that doth not break any Temporal Law? And eſpecially ſuch Men that hath a Commiſſion from God to give Sentance of Eternal Damnation upon them, leaſt they come under the ſame Condemnation as theſe Men are under.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. This I have left upon Record for the Age to come, after my Death, ſome of the moſt Remarkable Sufferings which I have paſſed through in the Year 1676.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="chapter">
                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Prophets deliverance out of Priſon; of the Price and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that was made of him: The Rewards to the two Seeds at the laſt Day.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW having given an Account of my Sufferings, it will be neceſſary to give an Account of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of thoſe Troubles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. While I was in the <hi>Preſs-yard,</hi> Priſoner, the Sheriffs did ſend ſeveral times by the Goal keepers to ſee what I would do about the Fine, but they were at no certainty, what they required: At laſt the Clerk of <hi>Newgate</hi> ſaid, <hi>they would take the</hi> 5th <hi>Part,</hi> which was one Hundred Pound.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I was unwilling to give ſo much, I let it alone a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Year longer, for ſome Reaſons I had in my ſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time I ſent a Letter to Treat with them about the Fine: The Sheriffs Names was one Sr. <hi>John Peak,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> the other was Sr. <hi>Thomas Stamp,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But they were very high, and would not abate one
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62853:93"/>
Shilling of one Hundred Pound, and the cauſe why, was becauſe ſome of the Goal Keepers, had Proffered one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound for me, to keep a Priſoner for ever, or elſe to have a large Summ of Money for my Ranſome.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I perceive, had not the Shreiffs Honour layn at the ſtake, I had been Bought and Sold as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in <hi>Egypt</hi> for a Priſoner during Life, or till ſuch Ranſome was Paid: It would have been a great Diſparragment to the Sheriffs, if they had Sold me, ſuch as was never done in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But they having an Eye to Credit, and ſomewhat to Conſcience, they would not do ſuch Wickedneſs; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cauſed them to abate nothing of one Hundred Pound neither would they give any time, but Pay down preſently.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So We Borrowed an Hundred Pound the next Day, and gave to them, upon the 19th Day of <hi>July</hi> 1677, and the ſame Day at Night I was Releaſed out of Priſon, and many of the Believers do keep that Day as a Feaſt Day every Year, in Remembrance of my Deliverance out of Priſon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For I was Prized at a goodly Price, far Higher than the Lord of Life, when he was on Earth: He was valued at but Thirty Pieces of Silver, the Thirty Pieces of Silver was Thirty Pound, but they valued me at a Hundred Pieces of Silver, for the Thirty Pieces of Silver they valued Chriſt at, muſt be ſo much, elſe it would not have Bought the Potters Field.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now the cauſe why they valued me at ſuch a High Price above my Lord and Maſter, it was becauſe they knew I had ſome Intereſt in this World: And many followers of me, therefore they valued me at ſuch a High Price as 100 Pieces of Silver.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And as the Thirty Pieces of Silver was the Price of Innocent Blood, therefore not fit to be put into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, to be Expended upon any Holy uſe, or to Relieve the Poor and the like; but to Buy a Potters Field to Bury the Stinking Carcaſſes of ſtrangers, Thieves, and Murderers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Thirty Pieces of Silver was beſtowed on
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62853:94"/>
the baſeſt way, ſuitable to the Purchaſe; being the Price of Innocent Blood.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. So likewiſe the Hundred Pieces of Silver they valued me at, it was the Price of Innocent Blood alſo, tho' not unto Death, as our Lord was a very Goodly Price.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And this Money will not be put into the Treaſury, to repair Churches, or Relieve the Poor, but will be ſpent baſely in Luſt and Drunkenneſs, and in Volumptiouſneſs ſuitable to the Purchaſe of it, being the Price of Innocent Blood.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus I have left upon Record, the ſubſtance of the whole matter, as ſhort as I can, both of my Sufferings and my Deliverance out of all thoſe Troubles that hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me in the Year 1675, and in the Year 1676, and 1677, and in the Year of my Life 67.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This is the 5th part of the Acts of <hi>John Reeve</hi> and <hi>Lodowich Muggleton,</hi> the two laſt Prophets, and Witneſſes of the Spirit, from the Year 1651 to the Year 1677 I have been preſerved, and had Experience of the Truth of all theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And wonderful Revelations, and paſſages, and Acts, that are Writen in theſe Five Parts, that I might leave it as a Legacy for the Age to come upon Record, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing World may be convinced when I am turned to Duſt, as my Father <hi>Adam</hi> is, that I was Slandered, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, Belyed, Perſecuted, Impriſoned, and Pilloried, without a Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But I ſhall be raiſed again, by the Power of that God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom I Believed, that he was Dead, even the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and is Alive for Evermore.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And it will not ſeem a quarter of an Hours time to me from my Death, to my Riſing again: For there is no time to the Dead: Time belongs to the Living.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And this I know, that as the 12 Apoſtles in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, ſhall Sit upon Thrones and Judge the 12 Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> thoſe that Believed them when they were upon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62853:94"/>
the Earth. They were Judged with an Eternal Bleſſing of Life Eternal, and thoſe that Diſpiſed, and Perſecuted them when on Earth, are Judged by them to be Curſed and Damn'd to Eternity, which is a Second Death which is Eternal.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So ſhall <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> in the Reſurrection Sit upon Thrones, and Judge all True Believers of our Docter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and Commiſſion of the Spirit, when we were upon Earth, to be Bleſſed both in Souls and Bodies, that were Mortal when they believed us, but now Immortal to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And we ſhall Judge all thoſe Wicked Deſpiſers and Perſecutors of us when we were upon Earth with the ſame Judgment in the Reſurrection, as we did here on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. That is, they are Curſed in that Soul and Body they ſhall have in the Reſurrection to Eternity; and ſhall remain in utter Darkneſs here upon this Earth: Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth for Evermore.</p>
